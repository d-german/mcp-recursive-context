# mcp-recursive-context
An MCP server for recursive reasoning over massive offline context.
This MCP server enables large language models to systematically search, traverse, and reason over massive offline context (e.g. large codebases or document sets) without loading that context into the model’s prompt.

It implements a recursive reasoning algorithm that allows the model to incrementally inspect external data, follow execution paths, and synthesize results across arbitrarily large inputs.
