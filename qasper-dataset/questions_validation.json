Given an input question and a set of candidate entities retrieved by an entity linker based on the question, our proposed relation detection model plays a key role in the KBQA process: (1) Re-ranking the entity candidates according to whether they connect to high confident relations detected from the raw question text by the relation detection model. This step is important to deal with the ambiguities normally present in entity linking results. (2) Finding the core relation (chains) for each topic entity selection from a much smaller candidate entity set after re-ranking. The above steps are followed by an optional constraint detection step, when the question cannot be answered by single relations (e.g., multiple entities in the question).

          "Recall from Definition 1 that the self-similarity of a word, in a given layer of a given model, is the average cosine similarity between its representations in different contexts, adjusted for anisotropy. If the self-similarity is 1, then the representations are not context-specific at all; if the self-similarity is 0, that the representations are maximally context-specific. In Figure FIGREF24, we plot the average self-similarity of uniformly randomly sampled words in each layer of BERT, ELMo, and GPT-2. For example, the self-similarity is 1.0 in ELMo's input layer because representations in that layer are static character-level embeddings.",
          "In all three models, the higher the layer, the lower the self-similarity is on average. In other words, the higher the layer, the more context-specific the contextualized representations. This finding makes intuitive sense. In image classification models, lower layers recognize more generic features such as edges while upper layers recognize more class-specific features BIBREF19. Similarly, upper layers of LSTMs trained on NLP tasks learn more task-specific representations BIBREF4. Therefore, it follows that upper layers of neural language models learn more context-specific representations, so as to predict the next word for a given context more accurately. Of all three models, representations in GPT-2 are the most context-specific, with those in GPT-2's last layer being almost maximally context-specific.",
          "As seen in Figure FIGREF20, for GPT-2, the average cosine similarity between uniformly randomly words is roughly 0.6 in layers 2 through 8 but increases exponentially from layers 8 through 12. In fact, word representations in GPT-2's last layer are so anisotropic that any two words have on average an almost perfect cosine similarity! This pattern holds for BERT and ELMo as well, though there are exceptions: for example, the anisotropy in BERT's penultimate layer is much higher than in its final layer.",
          "As word representations in a sentence become more context-specific in upper layers, they drift away from one another, although there are exceptions (see layer 12 in Figure FIGREF25). However, in all layers, the average similarity between words in the same sentence is still greater than the average similarity between randomly chosen words (i.e., the anisotropy baseline). This suggests a more nuanced contextualization than in ELMo, with BERT recognizing that although the surrounding sentence informs a word's meaning, two words in the same sentence do not necessarily have a similar meaning because they share the same context."

          "In addition to the raw IPA transcriptions extracted from Wiktionary, the corpus provides an automatically cleaned version of transcriptions. Cleaning is a necessary step because web-scraped data is often noisy and may be transcribed at an inconsistent level of detail. The data cleaning used here attempts to make the transcriptions consistent with the phonemic inventories used in Phoible BIBREF4 . When a transcription contains a phoneme that is not in its language's inventory in Phoible, that phoneme is replaced by the phoneme with the most similar articulatory features that is in the language's inventory. Sometimes this cleaning algorithm works well: in the German examples in Table TABREF11 , the raw German symbols and are both converted to . This is useful because the in Ansbach and the in Kaninchen are instances of the same phoneme, so their phonemic representations should use the same symbol. However, the cleaning algorithm can also have negative effects on the data quality. For example, the phoneme is not present in the Phoible inventory for German, but it is used in several German transcriptions in the corpus. The cleaning algorithm converts to in all German transcriptions, whereas would be a more reasonable guess. The cleaning algorithm also removes most suprasegmentals, even though these are often an important part of a language's phonology. Developing a more sophisticated procedure for cleaning pronunciation data is a direction for future work, but in this paper we use the corpus's provided cleaned transcriptions in order to ease comparison to previous results."

It also shows that while adding synthetic data from the baseline is not always helpful, adding synthetic data from the template model helps to improve both the training and the tuning process. In both CS and ENGR courses, tuning with synthetic data enhances all ROUGE scores compared to tuning with only the original data. (rows 9 and 11).

For example, BIBREF4 reported the results of training on CNN/DM data while evaluating on DUC data without any tuning. Note that these two datasets are both in the news domain, and both consist of well written, structured documents. The domain transfer experiments of BIBREF1 similarly used two different news summarization datasets (CNN/DM and NYT). Our work differs in several ways from these two prior domain transfer efforts. First, our experiments involve two entirely different domains: news and student reflections. Unlike news, student reflection documents lack global structure, are repetitive, and contain many sentence fragments and grammatical mistakes. Second, the prior approaches either trained a part of the model using NYT data while retaining the other part of the model trained only on CNN/DM data BIBREF1, or didn't perform any tuning at all BIBREF4. In contrast, we do the training in two consecutive phases, pretraining and fine tuning. Finally, BIBREF1 reported that while training with domain transfer outperformed training only on out-of-domain data, it was not able to beat training only on in-domain data. This is likely because their in and out-of-domain data sizes are comparable, unlike in our case of scarce in-domain data."

The state with the fewest bloggers is Delaware with 1,217 users. Not surprisingly, this distribution correlates well with the population of these states, with a Spearman's rank correlation INLINEFORM0 of 0.91 and a p-value INLINEFORM1 0.0001, and is very similar to the one reported in Lin and Halavais Lin04.",
          "We also generate two maps that delineate the gender distribution in the dataset. Overall, the blogging world seems to be dominated by females: out of 153,209 users who self-reported their gender, only 52,725 are men and 100,484 are women. Figures FIGREF1 and FIGREF1 show the percentage of male and female bloggers in each of the 50 states. As seen in this figure, there are more than the average number of male bloggers in states such as California and New York, whereas Utah and Idaho have a higher percentage of women bloggers."

MEM is a topic modeling approach applied to a corpus of texts created by hundreds of survey respondents from the U.S. who were asked to freely write about their personal values. To illustrate, Figure FIGREF9 shows the geographical distributions of two of these value themes: Religion and Hard Work. Southeastern states often considered as the nation's “Bible Belt” BIBREF11 were found to have generally higher usage of Religion words such as God, bible, and church. Another broad trend was that western-central states (e.g., Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa) commonly blogged about Hard Work, using words such as hard, work, and job more often than bloggers in other regions."

We evaluated our experiments on two classification tasks - customer satisfaction prediction and topic identification - using 3 datasets: CSAT, 20newsgroups and Fisher. We observed that ToBERT outperforms RoBERT on pre-trained BERT features and fine-tuned BERT features for all our tasks. Also, we noticed that fine-tuned BERT performs better than pre-trained BERT. We have shown that both RoBERT and ToBERT improved the simple baselines of taking an average (or the most frequent) of segment-wise predictions for long documents to obtain final prediction. Position embeddings did not significantly affect our models performance, but slightly improved the accuracy on the CSAT task. We obtained the best results on Fisher dataset and good improvements for CSAT task compared to the CNN baseline. It is interesting to note that the longer the average input in a given task, the bigger improvement we observe w.r.t. the baseline for that task. Our results confirm that both RoBERT and ToBERT can be used for long sequences with competitive performance and quick fine-tuning procedure. For future work, we shall focus on training models on long documents directly (i.e. in an end-to-end manner)."

          "Dialogue Manager consists of the Dialogue State Tracker (DST), that maintains a representation of the current dialog state, and of the Policy Learner (PL) that defines the next system action. In our model, the system's next action is defined by the state of the previously obtained information stored in the Information Dictionary. For instance, if the system recognizes that the student works on the final examination, it also understands (defined by the logic in the predefined rules) that there is no need to ask for sub-topic because the final examination always corresponds to a chapter level (due to the design of OMB+ platform). If the system identifies that the user has difficulties in solving a quiz, it has to ask for the corresponding topic and sub-topic if not yet provided by a user (because the quiz always refers to a section level). To determine all of the potential dialogue flows, we implemented Mutually Exclusive Rules (MER), which indicate that two events $e_{1}$ and $e_{2}$ are mutually exclusive or disjoint if they cannot both occur at the same time (thus, the intersection of these events is empty: $P(A \\cap B) = 0$). Additionally, we defined transition and mapping rules. The formal explanation of rules can be found in Section SECREF12 of the Appendix. Following the rules, we generated 56 state transitions, which define next system actions. Being on a new dialogue state, the system compares the extracted (i.e., updated) information in the ID with the valid dialogue states (see Section SECREF12 of the Appendix for the explanation of the validness) and picks the mapped action as the next system's action."

However, since the user-input was informal, the same information could be provided in different writing styles. That means that a single entity could have different surface forms (e.g., synonyms, writing styles) (although entities that we extracted from the rule-based system were all converted to a universal standard, e.g., official chapter names). To consider all of the variable entity forms while post-labeling the original dataset, we defined generic entity names (e.g., chapter, question nr.) and mapped variations of entities from the user input (e.g., Chapter = [Elementary Calculus, Chapter $I$, ...]) to them.",

We also note that the trained models surpass the baseline for all languages, and that the timestamp feature (denoted by TS), while not required to beat the baseline, has a very relevant contribution in all cases. Although the results for both the baseline and our models seem to differ across languages, one can verify a consistent improvement from the latter to the former, suggesting that the score differences should be mostly tied to the different difficulty found across the datasets for each language.

This section describes in detail the 5 different datasets we build, which are drawn from two sources of expert knowledge, namely WordNet BIBREF35 and the GNU Collaborative International Dictionary of English (GCIDE). We describe each resource in turn, and explain how the resulting dataset probes, which we call WordNetQA and DictionaryQA, are constructed.",
          "For convenience, we will describe each source of expert knowledge as a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. The nodes of this graph are $\\mathcal {V} = \\mathcal {C} \\cup \\mathcal {W} \\cup \\mathcal {S} \\cup \\mathcal {D}$, where $\\mathcal {C}$ is a set of atomic concepts, $\\mathcal {W}$ a set of words, $\\mathcal {S}$ a set of sentences, and $\\mathcal {D}$ a set of definitions (see Table TABREF4 for details for WordNet and GCIDE). Each edge of $G$ is directed from an atomic concept in $\\mathcal {C}$ to another node in $V$, and is labeled with a relation, such as hypernym or isa$^\\uparrow $, from a set of relations $\\mathcal {R}$ (see Table TABREF4).",
          "When defining our probe question templates, it will be useful to view $G$ as a set of (relation, source, target) triples $\\mathcal {T} \\subseteq \\mathcal {R} \\times \\mathcal {C} \\times \\mathcal {V}$. Due to their origin in an expert knowledge source, such triples preserve semantic consistency. For instance, when the relation in a triple is def, the corresponding edge maps a concept in $\\mathcal {C}$ to a definition in $\\mathcal {D}$.",
          "To construct probe datasets, we rely on two heuristic functions, defined below for each individual probe: $\\textsc {gen}_{\\mathcal {Q}}(\\tau )$, which generates gold question-answer pairs $(\\textbf {q},\\textbf {a})$ from a set of triples $\\tau \\subseteq \\mathcal {T}$ and question templates $\\mathcal {Q}$, and $\\textsc {distr}(\\tau ^{\\prime })$, which generates distractor answers choices $\\lbrace a^{\\prime }_{1},...a^{\\prime }_{N-1} \\rbrace $ based on another set of triples $\\tau ^{\\prime }$ (where usually $\\tau \\subset \\tau ^{\\prime }$). For brevity, we will use $\\textsc {gen}(\\tau )$ to denote $\\textsc {gen}_{\\mathcal {Q}}(\\tau )$, leaving question templates $\\mathcal {Q}$ implicit.",
          "Dataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA",
          "WordNet is an English lexical database consisting of around 117k concepts, which are organized into groups of synsets that each contain a gloss (i.e., a definition of the target concept), a set of representative English words (called lemmas), and, in around 33k synsets, example sentences. In addition, many synsets have ISA links to other synsets that express complex taxonomic relations. Figure FIGREF6 shows an example and Table TABREF4 summarizes how we formulate WordNet as a set of triples $\\mathcal {T}$ of various types. These triples together represent a directed, edge-labeled graph $G$. Our main motivation for using WordNet, as opposed to a resource such as ConceptNet BIBREF36, is the availability of glosses ($\\mathcal {D}$) and example sentences ($\\mathcal {S}$), which allows us to construct natural language questions that contextualize the types of concepts we want to probe.",
          "Dataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Example Generation @!START@$\\textsc {gen}(\\tau )$@!END@.",
          "We build 4 individual datasets based on semantic relations native to WordNet (see BIBREF37): hypernymy (i.e., generalization or ISA reasoning up a taxonomy, ISA$^\\uparrow $), hyponymy (ISA$^{\\downarrow }$), synonymy, and definitions. To generate a set of questions in each case, we employ a number of rule templates $\\mathcal {Q}$ that operate over tuples. A subset of such templates is shown in Table TABREF8. The templates were designed to mimic naturalistic questions we observed in our science benchmarks.",
          "For example, suppose we wish to create a question $\\textbf {q}$ about the definition of a target concept $c \\in \\mathcal {C}$. We first select a question template from $\\mathcal {Q}$ that first introduces the concept $c$ and its lemma $l \\in \\mathcal {W}$ in context using the example sentence $s \\in \\mathcal {S}$, and then asks to identify the corresponding WordNet gloss $d \\in \\mathcal {D}$, which serves as the gold answer $\\textbf {a}$. The same is done for ISA reasoning; each question about a hypernym/hyponym relation between two concepts $c \\rightarrow ^{\\uparrow /\\downarrow } c^{\\prime } \\in \\mathcal {T}_{i}$ (e.g., $\\texttt {dog} \\rightarrow ^{\\uparrow /\\downarrow } \\texttt {animal/terrier}$) first introduces a context for $c$ and then asks for an answer that identifies $c^{\\prime }$ (which is also provided with a gloss so as to contain all available context).",
          "In the latter case, the rules $(\\texttt {isa}^{r},c,c^{\\prime }) \\in \\mathcal {T}_i$ in Table TABREF8 cover only direct ISA links from $c$ in direction $r \\in \\lbrace \\uparrow ,\\downarrow \\rbrace $. In practice, for each $c$ and direction $r$, we construct tests that cover the set HOPS$(c,r)$ of all direct as well as derived ISA relations of $c$:",

          "An example of how distractors are generated is shown in Figure FIGREF6, which relies on similar principles as above. For each concept $c$, we choose 4 distractor answers that are close in the WordNet semantic space. For example, when constructing hypernymy tests for $c$ from the set hops$(c,\\uparrow )$, we build distractors by drawing from $\\textsc {hops}(c,\\downarrow )$ (and vice versa), as well as from the $\\ell $-deep sister family of $c$, defined as follows. The 1-deep sister family is simply $c$'s siblings or sisters, i.e., the other children $\\tilde{c} \\ne c$ of the parent node $c^{\\prime }$ of $c$. For $\\ell > 1$, the $\\ell $-deep sister family also includes all descendants of each $\\tilde{c}$ up to $\\ell -1$ levels deep, denoted $\\textsc {hops}_{\\ell -1}(\\tilde{c},\\downarrow )$. Formally:",
          "For definitions and synonyms we build distractors from all of these sets (with a similar restriction on the depth of sister distractors as noted above). In doing this, we can systematically investigate model performance on a wide range of distractor sets.",
          "Dataset Probes and Construction ::: WordNetQA ::: Perturbations and Semantic Clusters",
          "Based on how we generate data, for each concept $c$ (i.e., atomic WordNet synset) and probe type (i.e., definitions, hypernymy, etc.), we have a wide variety of questions related to $c$ that manipulate 1) the complexity of reasoning that is involved (e.g., the number of inferential hops) and; 2) the types of distractors (or distractor perturbations) that are employed. We call such sets semantic clusters. As we describe in the next section, semantic clusters allow us to devise new types of evaluation that reveal whether models have comprehensive and consistent knowledge of target concepts (e.g., evaluating whether a model can correctly answer several questions associated with a concept, as opposed to a few disjoint instances).",
          "Details of the individual datasets are shown in Table TABREF12. From these sets, we follow BIBREF22 in allocating a maximum of 3k examples for training and reserve the rest for development and testing. Since we are interested in probing, having large held-out sets allows us to do detailed analysis and cluster-based evaluation.",

          "The DictionaryQA dataset is created from the GCIDE dictionary, which is a comprehensive open-source English dictionary built largely from the Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary BIBREF38. Each entry consists of a word, its part-of-speech, its definition, and an optional example sentence (see Table TABREF14). Overall, 33k entries (out of a total of 155k) contain example sentences/usages. As with the WordNet probes, we focus on this subset so as to contextualize each word being probed. In contrast to WordNet, GCIDE does not have ISA relations or explicit synsets, so we take each unique entry to be a distinct sense. We then use the dictionary entries to create a probe that centers around word-sense disambiguation, as described below.",
          "Dataset Probes and Construction ::: DictionaryQA ::: Example and Distractor Generation.",
          "To generate gold questions and answers, we use the same generation templates for definitions exemplified in Figure TABREF8 for WordNetQA. To generate distractors, we simply take alternative definitions for the target words that represent a different word sense (e.g., the alternative definitions of gift shown in Table TABREF14), as well as randomly chosen definitions if needed to create a 5-way multiple choice question. As above, we reserve a maximum of 3k examples for training. Since we have only 9k examples in total in this dataset (see WordSense in Table TABREF12), we also reserve 3k each for development and testing.",
          "We note that initial attempts to build this dataset through standard random splitting gave rise to certain systematic biases that were exploited by the choice-only baseline models described in the next section, and hence inflated overall model scores. After several efforts at filtering we found that, among other factors, using definitions from entries without example sentences as distractors (e.g., the first two entries in Table TABREF14) had a surprising correlation with such biases. This suggests that possible biases involving differences between dictionary entries with and without examples can taint the resulting automatically generated MCQA dataset (for more discussion on the pitfalls involved with automatic dataset construction, see Section SECREF5)."

They test their approach on Zork1, showing the combination of the knowledge graph and template action selection resulted in improvements over existing methods. They note that their approach reaches a score of 40 which corresponds to a bottleneck in Zork1 where the player is eaten by a “grue” (resulting in negative reward) if the player has not first lit a lamp. The lamp must be lit many steps after first being encountered, in a different section of the game; this action is necessary to continue exploring but doesn’t immediately produce any positive reward. That is, there is a long term dependency between actions that is not immediately rewarded, as seen in Figure FIGREF1. Others using artificially constrained action spaces also report an inability to pass through this bottleneck BIBREF7, BIBREF8. They pose a significant challenge for these methods because the agent does not see the correct action sequence to pass the bottleneck enough times. This is in part due to the fact that for that sequence to be reinforced, the agent needs to reach the next possible reward beyond the bottleneck."

          "KG-A2C-Explore Go-Explore BIBREF9 is an algorithm that is designed to keep track of sub-optimal and under-explored states in order to allow the agent to explore upon more optimal states that may be a result of sparse rewards. The Go-Explore algorithm consists of two phases, the first to continuously explore until a set of promising states and corresponding trajectories are found on the basis of total score, and the second to robustify this found policy against potential stochasticity in the game. Promising states are defined as those states when explored from will likely result in higher reward trajectories. Since the text games we are dealing with are mostly deterministic, with the exception of Zork in later stages, we only focus on using Phase 1 of the Go-Explore algorithm to find an optimal policy. BIBREF10 look at applying Go-Explore to text-games on a set of simpler games generated using the game generation framework TextWorld BIBREF1. Instead of training a policy network in parallel to generate actions used for exploration, they use a small set of “admissible actions”—actions guaranteed to change the world state at any given step during Phase 1—to explore and find high reward trajectories. This space of actions is relatively small (of the order of $10^2$ per step) and so finding high reward trajectories in larger action-spaces such as in Zork would be infeasible",
          "Go-Explore maintains an archive of cells—defined as a set of states that map to a single representation—to keep track of promising states. BIBREF9 simply encodes each cell by keeping track of the agent's position and BIBREF10 use the textual observations encoded by recurrent neural network as a cell representation. We improve on this implementation by training the KG-A2C network in parallel, using the snapshot of the knowledge graph in conjunction with the game state to further encode the current state and use this as a cell representation. At each step, Go-Explore chooses a cell to explore at random (weighted by score to prefer more advanced cells). The KG-A2C will run for a number of steps, starting with the knowledge graph state and the last seen state of the game from the cell. This will generate a trajectory for the agent while further training the KG-A2C at each iteration, creating a new representation for the knowledge graph as well as a new game state for the cell. After expanding a cell, Go-Explore will continue to sample cells by weight to continue expanding its known states. At the same time, KG-A2C will benefit from the heuristics of selecting preferred cells and be trained on promising states more often."

          "Evaluation-I: Strategy Formulation Ability. Table 5 shows the list of inference strategies formulated by LiLi for various INLINEFORM0 and INLINEFORM1 , which control the strategy formulation of LiLi. When INLINEFORM2 , LiLi cannot interact with user and works like a closed-world method. Thus, INLINEFORM3 drops significantly (0.47). When INLINEFORM4 , i.e. with only one interaction per query, LiLi acquires knowledge well for instances where either of the entities or relation is unknown. However, as one unknown entity may appear in multiple test triples, once the entity becomes known, LiLi doesn’t need to ask for it again and can perform inference on future triples causing significant increase in INLINEFORM5 (0.97). When INLINEFORM6 , LiLi is able to perform inference on all instances and INLINEFORM7 becomes 1. For INLINEFORM8 , LiLi uses INLINEFORM9 only once (as only one MLQ satisfies INLINEFORM10 ) compared to INLINEFORM11 . In summary, LiLi’s RL-model can effectively formulate query-specific inference strategies (based on specified parameter values). Evaluation-II: Predictive Performance. Table 6 shows the comparative performance of LiLi with baselines. To judge the overall improvements, we performed paired t-test considering +ve F1 scores on each relation as paired data. Considering both KBs and all relation types, LiLi outperforms Sep with INLINEFORM12 . If we set INLINEFORM13 (training with very few clues), LiLi outperforms Sep with INLINEFORM14 on Freebase considering MCC. Thus, the lifelong learning mechanism is effective in transferring helpful knowledge. Single model performs better than Sep for unknown relations due to the sharing of knowledge (weights) across tasks. However, for known relations, performance drops because, as a new relation arrives to the system, old weights get corrupted and catastrophic forgetting occurs. For unknown relations, as the relations are evaluated just after training, there is no chance for catastrophic forgetting. The performance improvement ( INLINEFORM15 ) of LiLi over F-th on Freebase signifies that the relation-specific threshold INLINEFORM16 works better than fixed threshold 0.5 because, if all prediction values for test instances lie above (or below) 0.5, F-th predicts all instances as +ve (-ve) which degrades its performance. Due to the utilization of contextual similarity (highly correlated with class labels) of entity-pairs, LiLi’s guessing mechanism works better ( INLINEFORM17 ) than blind guessing (BG). The past task selection mechanism of LiLi also improves its performance over w/o PTS, as it acquires more clues during testing for poorly performed tasks (evaluated on validation set). For Freebase, due to a large number of past tasks [9 (25% of 38)], the performance difference is more significant ( INLINEFORM18 ). For WordNet, the number is relatively small [3 (25% of 14)] and hence, the difference is not significant.",

          "As lifelong learning needs to retain knowledge learned from past tasks and use it to help future learning BIBREF31 , LiLi uses a Knowledge Store (KS) for knowledge retention. KS has four components: (i) Knowledge Graph ( INLINEFORM0 ): INLINEFORM1 (the KB) is initialized with base KB triples (see §4) and gets updated over time with the acquired knowledge. (ii) Relation-Entity Matrix ( INLINEFORM2 ): INLINEFORM3 is a sparse matrix, with rows as relations and columns as entity-pairs and is used by the prediction model. Given a triple ( INLINEFORM4 , INLINEFORM5 , INLINEFORM6 ) INLINEFORM7 , we set INLINEFORM8 [ INLINEFORM9 , ( INLINEFORM10 , INLINEFORM11 )] = 1 indicating INLINEFORM12 occurs for pair ( INLINEFORM13 , INLINEFORM14 ). (iii) Task Experience Store ( INLINEFORM15 ): INLINEFORM16 stores the predictive performance of LiLi on past learned tasks in terms of Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) that measures the quality of binary classification. So, for two tasks INLINEFORM17 and INLINEFORM18 (each relation is a task), if INLINEFORM19 [ INLINEFORM20 ] INLINEFORM21 INLINEFORM22 [ INLINEFORM23 ] [where INLINEFORM24 [ INLINEFORM25 ]=MCC( INLINEFORM26 )], we say C-PR has learned INLINEFORM27 well compared to INLINEFORM28 . (iv) Incomplete Feature DB ( INLINEFORM29 ): INLINEFORM30 stores the frequency of an incomplete path INLINEFORM31 in the form of a tuple ( INLINEFORM32 , INLINEFORM33 , INLINEFORM34 ) and is used in formulating MLQs. INLINEFORM35 [( INLINEFORM36 , INLINEFORM37 , INLINEFORM38 )] = INLINEFORM39 implies LiLi has extracted incomplete path INLINEFORM40 INLINEFORM41 times involving entity-pair INLINEFORM42 [( INLINEFORM43 , INLINEFORM44 )] for query relation INLINEFORM45 .",
          "The RL model learns even after training whenever it encounters an unseen state (in testing) and thus, gets updated over time. KS is updated continuously over time as a result of the execution of LiLi and takes part in future learning. The prediction model uses lifelong learning (LL), where we transfer knowledge (parameter values) from the model for a past most similar task to help learn for the current task. Similar tasks are identified by factorizing INLINEFORM0 and computing a task similarity matrix INLINEFORM1 . Besides LL, LiLi uses INLINEFORM2 to identify poorly learned past tasks and acquire more clues for them to improve its skillset over time.",
          "LiLi also uses a stack, called Inference Stack ( INLINEFORM0 ) to hold query and its state information for RL. LiLi always processes stack top ( INLINEFORM1 [top]). The clues from the user get stored in INLINEFORM2 on top of the query during strategy execution and processed first. Thus, the prediction model for INLINEFORM3 is learned before performing inference on query, transforming OKBC to a KBC problem. Table 1 shows the parameters of LiLi used in the following sections."

According to Table TABREF22 , adding interpretations of neighbouring words ( INLINEFORM0 ) yields very little improvement, while this type of information regarding replacements ( INLINEFORM1 ) even lowers the accuracy. This result could be attributed to two factors. Firstly, more developed replacement generation results in more occurrences, but also causes their tags to differ from the target word by gender or number. They may even not be available at all (in the case of multi-word replacements). The second reason is a difference in language: while in English a word interpretation is represented as one of several dozen part of speech identifiers, in Slavonic languages, such as Polish, we need to specify the values of several tags for each word, leading to thousands of possible interpretations. Obviously, the features based on these tags are very sparse. Finally, the morphosyntactic annotation was performed automatically, which may lead to errors, especially in the case of noisy web text."

The aim of my study is to explore the limitations of this technique by implementing and evaluating such a tool for Polish. Firstly, the method is expanded by waiving the requirement of monosemy and proposing several new sources of relatives. These previously unexplored sources are based on wordnet data and help gather many training cases from the corpus. Secondly, a well-known problem of uneven yet unknown distribution of word senses is alleviated by modifying a naïve Bayesian classifier. Thanks to this correction, the classifier is no longer biased towards senses that have more training data. Finally, a very large corpus (600 million documents), gathered from the web by a Polish search engine NEKST, is used to build models based on training corpora of different sizes. Those experiments show what amount of data is sufficient for such a task. The proposed solution is compared to baselines that use wordnet structure only, with no training corpora.",

Some of the replacements may have multiple senses, however usually one of them covers most cases. Secondly, a set of context features is extracted from occurrences of relatives in the NEKST corpus.

          "With their ability to operate freely on social media now curtailed, ISIS recruiters and propagandists increased their attentiveness to another longstanding tool–English language online magazines targeting western audiences. Al Hayat, the media wing of ISIS, published multiple online magazines in different languages including English. The English online magazine of ISIS was named Dabiq and first appeared on the dark web on July 2014 and continued publishing for 15 issues. This publication was followed by Rumiyah which produced 13 English language issues through September 2017. The content of these magazines provides a valuable but underutilized resource for understanding ISIS strategies and how they appeal to recruits, specifically English-speaking audiences. They also provide a way to compare ISIS' approach with other radical groups. Ingram compared Dabiq contents with Inspire (Al Qaeda publication) and suggested that Al Qaeda heavily emphasized identity-choice, while ISIS' messages were more balanced between identity-choice and rational-choice BIBREF7. In another research paper, Wignell et al. BIBREF8 compared Dabiq and Rumiah by examining their style and what both magazine messages emphasized. Despite the volume of research on these magazines, only a few researchers used lexical analysis and mostly relied on experts' opinions. BIBREF9 is one exception to this approach where they used word frequency on 11 issues of Dabiq publications and compared attributes such as anger, anxiety, power, motive, etc.",
          "Finding useful collections of texts where ISIS targets women is a challenging task. Most of the available material are not reflecting ISIS' official point of view or they do not talk specifically about women. However, ISIS' online magazines are valuable resources for understanding how the organization attempts to appeal to western audiences, particularly women. Looking through both Dabiq and Rumiyah, many issues of the magazines contain articles specifically addressing women, usually with “ to our sisters ” incorporated into the title. Seven out of fifteen Dabiq issues and all thirteen issues of Rumiyah contain articles targeting women, clearly suggesting an increase in attention to women over time."

The resulting non-negative matrices are such that their product closely approximate the original data. Mathematically speaking, given an input matrix of document-terms $V$, NMF finds two matrices by solving the following equation BIBREF20:"

          "A comparison of common words suggests that those related to marital relationships ( husband, wife, etc.) appear in both corpora, but the religious theme of ISIS material appears to be stronger. A stronger comparison can be made using topic modeling techniques to discover main topics of these documents. Although we used LDA, our results by using NMF outperform LDA topics, due to the nature of these corpora. Also, fewer numbers of ISIS documents might contribute to the comparatively worse performance. Therefore, we present only NMF results. Based on their coherence, we selected 10 topics for analyzing within both corporas. Table TABREF18 and Table TABREF19 show the most important words in each topic with a general label that we assigned to the topic manually. Based on the NMF output, ISIS articles that address women include topics mainly about Islam, women's role in early Islam, hijrah (moving to another land), spousal relations, marriage, and motherhood."

ShapeWorld is a controlled data generation framework consisting of abstract colored shapes (see Figure FIGREF1 for an example). We use ShapeWorld to generate training and evaluation data for two major reasons. ShapeWorld supports customized data generation according to user specification, which enables a variety of model inspections in terms of language construction, visual complexity and reasoning ability. Another benefit is that each training and test instance generated in ShapeWorld is returned as a triplet of $<$image, caption, world model$>$. The world model stores information about the underlying microworld used to generate an image and a descriptive caption, internally represented as a list of entities with their attributes, such as shape, color, position. During data generation, ShapeWorld randomly samples a world model from a set of available entities and attributes. The generated world model is then used to realize a corresponding instance consisting of image and caption. The world model gives the actual semantic information contained in an image, which allows evaluation of caption truthfulness."

This shows that translation degrades the quality of data. There are some exceptions when testing on Korean. Translating the English training data into Chinese, Japanese and Korean still improve the performance on Korean. We also found that when translated into the same language, the English training data is always better than the Chinese data (En-XX v.s. Zh-XX), with only one exception (En-Fr v.s. Zh-Fr when testing on KorQuAD). This may be because we have less Chinese training data than English. These results show that the quality and the size of dataset are much more important than whether the training and testing are in the same language or not.",

An obvious issue with this method is that some examples might no longer have a recoverable span. To solve the problem, we use fuzzy matching to find the most possible answer, which calculates minimal edit distance between translated answer and all possible spans. If the minimal edit distance is larger than min(10, lengths of translated answer - 1), we drop the examples during training, and treat them as noise when testing. In this way, we can recover more than 95% of examples. The following generated datasets are recovered with same setting."

In row (f), multi-BERT is fine-tuned on English but tested on Chinese, which achieves competitive performance compared with QANet trained on Chinese. We also find that multi-BERT trained on English has relatively lower EM compared with the model with comparable F1 scores. This shows that the model learned with zero-shot can roughly identify the answer spans in context but less accurate. In row (c), we fine-tuned a BERT model pre-trained on English monolingual corpus (English BERT) on Chinese RC training data directly by appending fastText-initialized Chinese word embeddings to the original word embeddings of English-BERT. Its F1 score is even lower than that of zero-shot transferring multi-BERT (rows (c) v.s. (e)). The result implies multi-BERT does acquire better cross-lingual capability through pre-training on multilingual corpus. Table TABREF8 shows the results of multi-BERT fine-tuned on different languages and then tested on English , Chinese and Korean. The top half of the table shows the results of training data without translation. It is not surprising that when the training and testing sets are in the same language, the best results are achieved, and multi-BERT shows transfer capability when training and testing sets are in different languages, especially between Chinese and Korean.",
          "Reading Comprehension (RC) has become a central task in natural language processing, with great practical value in various industries. In recent years, many large-scale RC datasets in English BIBREF0, BIBREF1, BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, BIBREF6 have nourished the development of numerous powerful and diverse RC models BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF9, BIBREF10, BIBREF11. The state-of-the-art model BIBREF12 on SQuAD, one of the most widely used RC benchmarks, even surpasses human-level performance. Nonetheless, RC on languages other than English has been limited due to the absence of sufficient training data. Although some efforts have been made to create RC datasets for Chinese BIBREF13, BIBREF14 and Korean BIBREF15, it is not feasible to collect RC datasets for every language since annotation efforts to collect a new RC dataset are often far from trivial. Therefore, the setup of transfer learning, especially zero-shot learning, is of extraordinary importance."

On the other hand, visual contexts (visual tags: `parade', `urban area', ...) provide similarities to the token's distributional semantics from other training examples (snaps from “NBA Championship Parade Story\"), and thus the model successfully predicts the token as a named entity. Similarly, while the text-only model erroneously predicts `Apple' in the caption “Grandma w dat lit Apple Crisp\" as an organization (Apple Inc.), the visual contexts (describing objects related to food) help disambiguate the token, making the model predict it correctly as a non-named entity (a fruit). Trending entities (musicians or DJs such as `CID', `Duke Dumont', `Marshmello', etc.) are also recognized correctly with strengthened contexts from visual information (describing concert scenes) despite lack of surrounding textual contexts. A few cases where visual contexts harmed the performance mostly include visual tags that are unrelated to a token or its surrounding textual contexts."

Then we compute how the attention probability mass given to the words other than the alignment points, is distributed over dependency roles. Table TABREF33 gives the most attended roles for each POS tag. Here, we focus on POS tags discussed earlier.

We develop a new metric, PARENT (Precision And Recall of Entailed N-grams from the Table) (§ SECREF3 ). When computing precision, PARENT effectively uses a union of the reference and the table, to reward correct information missing from the reference. When computing recall, it uses an intersection of the reference and the table, to ignore extra incorrect information in the reference. The union and intersection are computed with the help of an entailment model to decide if a text n-gram is entailed by the table.

Follow the work BIBREF18 , we use the approximate randomization as the statistical significance test method BIBREF32 with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, at the confidence level 0.01 ( INLINEFORM0 ). As we can see in these tables, on both datasets, the neural extractive models outperforms the traditional extractive models on informativeness (ROUGE-1,2) by a wide margin, but results are mixed on ROUGE-L. Presumably, this is due to the neural training process, which relies on a goal standard based on ROUGE-1. Exploring other training schemes and/or a combination of traditional and neural approaches is left as future work. Similarly, the neural extractive models also dominate the neural abstractive models on ROUGE-1,2, but these abstractive models tend to have the highest ROUGE-L scores, possibly because they are trained directly on gold standard abstract summaries.",

MiniMayoSRS is a subset of the MayoSRS and consists of 30 term pairs on which a higher inter–annotator agreement was achieved. The average correlation between physicians is 0.68.

The similarity and relatedness of each term pair was annotated based on a continuous scale by having the resident touch a bar on a touch sensitive computer screen to indicate the degree of similarity or relatedness. The Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for the reference standard tagged for similarity was 0.47, and 0.50 for relatedness. Therefore, as suggested by Pakhomov and colleagues,we use a subset of the ratings consisting of 401 pairs for the similarity set and 430 pairs for the relatedness set which each have an ICC of 0.73."

The lookup for this entity in Wikidata is “Michael Jordan” and consequently will not be picked up if we were to use an exact string match. A simple method to circumvent such a problem is the usage of a redirection list. Such a list is provided on an entity by entity basis in the “Also known as” section in Wikidata. Using this redirection list, when we do not find an exact string match improves the recall of our model by 5-10%. Moreover, with the example of Michael Jordan (person), using our current framework, we will always refer to the retired basketball player (Q41421). We will never, for instance, pick up Michael Jordan (Q27069141) the American football cornerback. Or in fact any other Michael Jordan, famous or otherwise. One possible method to overcome this is to add a disambiguation layer, which seeks to use context from earlier parts of the text.

          "This work is most closely related to the paper from which we get the ERP data: BIBREF0 . In that work, the authors relate the surprisal of a word, i.e. the (negative log) probability of the word appearing in its context, to each of the ERP signals we consider here. The authors do not directly train a model to predict ERPs. Instead, models of the probability distribution of each word in context are used to compute a surprisal for each word, which is input into a mixed effects regression along with word frequency, word length, word position in the sentence, and sentence position in the experiment. The effect of the surprisal is assessed using a likelihood-ratio test. In BIBREF7 , the authors take an approach similar to BIBREF0 . The authors compare the explanatory power of surprisal (as computed by an LSTM or a Recurrent Neural Network Grammar (RNNG) language model) to a measure of syntactic complexity they call “distance\" that counts the number of parser actions in the RNNG language model. The authors find that surprisal (as predicted by the RNNG) and distance are both significant factors in a mixed effects regression which predicts the P600, while the surprisal as computed by an LSTM is not. Unlike BIBREF0 and BIBREF7 , we do not use a linking function (e.g. surprisal) to relate a language model to ERPs. We thus lose the interpretability provided by the linking function, but we are able to predict a significant proportion of the variance for all of the ERP components, where prior work could not. We interpret our results through characterization of the ERPs in terms of how they relate to each other and to eye-tracking data rather than through a linking function. The authors in BIBREF8 also use a recurrent neural network to predict neural activity directly. In that work the authors predict magnetoencephalography (MEG) activity, a close cousin to EEG, recorded while participants read a chapter of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone BIBREF9 . Their approach to characterization of processing at each MEG sensor location is to determine whether it is best predicted by the context vector of the recurrent network (prior to the current word being processed), the embedding of the current word, or the probability of the current word given the context.

We further enrich the qualitative annotations by a metric based on lexical cues in order to approximate a lower bound for the complexity of the reading comprehension task. By sampling entries from each gold standard and annotating them, we obtain measurable results and thus are able to make observations about the challenges present in that gold standard data."

          "Row (e) is the model that the weights of all layers are tied between the source domain and the target domain. Row (f) uses the same architecture as row (e) with an additional domain discriminator applied to the embedding encoder. It can be found that row (f) outperforms row (e), indicating that the proposed domain adversarial learning is helpful. Therefore, our following experiments contain domain adversarial learning. The proposed approach (row (f)) outperforms previous best model (row (c)) by 2% EM score and over 1.5% F1 score. We also show the results of applying the domain discriminator to the top of context query attention layer in row (g), which obtains poor performance. To sum it up, incorporating adversarial learning by applying the domain discriminator on top of the embedding encoder layer is effective."

Since its result in Li's paper was evaluated by IE model trained by Wiseman and “relexicalization” by Li, we adopted the corresponding IE model and re-implement “relexicalization” as suggested by Li for fair comparison. Please note that CC's evaluation results via our re-implemented “relexicalization” is comparable to the reported result in Li.

EqEmb-U model equations by treating them as sentences where the words are the equation variables, symbols and operators which we refer to as units. The first step in representing equations using equation units is to tokenize them. We use the approach outlined in BIBREF8 which represents equations into a syntax layout tree (SLT), a sequence of SLT tuples each of which contains the spatial relationship information between two equation symbols found within a particular window of equation symbols. Figure FIGREF11 shows example SLT representations of three equations."

As we deploy our text generation model for manual evaluation, we use a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model to predict which events to mention.",
          "The second human evaluation aimed at judging the acceptability of the output for production use in a news agency. The output is evaluated in terms of its usability for a news channel labelled as being machine-generated, i.e. not aiming at the level of a human journalist equipped with substantial background information. The evaluation was carried out by two journalists from the STT agency, who split the 59 games among themselves approximately evenly. The first journalist edited the games to a form corresponding to a draft for subsequent minor post-editing by a human, simulating the use of the generated output as a product where the final customer is expected to do own post-editing before publication. The second journalist directly edited the news to a state ready for direct publication in a news stream labeled as machine-generated news. In addition to correcting factual errors, the journalists removed excessive repetition, improved text fluency, as well as occasionally included important facts which the system left ungenerated. The WER measured against the output considered ready for post-editing, is 9.9% (11.2% disregarding punctuation), only slightly worse than the evaluation with only the factual and grammatical errors corrected. The WER measured against the output considered ready for direct release, was 22.0% (24.4% disregarding punctuation). In other words, 75–90% of the generated text can be directly used, depending on the expected post-editing effort.",

The word error rate (WER) of the generated text compared to its corrected variant as a reference is 5.6% (6.2% disregarding punctuation). The WER measure is defined as the number of insertions, substitutions, and deletions divided by the total length of the reference, in terms of tokens. The measure is the edit distance of the generated text and its corrected variant, directly reflecting the amount of effort needed to correct the generated output.",
          "The factual errors and their types are summarized in Table TABREF23. From the total of 510 game events generated by the system, 78 of these contained a factual error, i.e. 84.7% were generated without factual errors.",
          "Most fluency issues relate to the overall flow and structure of the report. Addressing these issues would require the model to take into account multiple events in a game, and combine the information more flexibly to avoid repetition. For instance, the output may repeatedly mention the period number for all goals in the same period. Likewise, this setup sometimes results in unnatural, yet grammatical, repetition of words across consecutive sentences. Even though the model has learned a selection of verbs meaning to score a goal, it is unable to ensure their varied use. While not successful in our initial experiments, generating text based on the multi-event alignments or at document level may eventually overcome these issues."

First, we pre-process each document to transform text into consecutive word tokens, where words are in their most normalised forms, and some words are removed if they have no distinctive meaning when used out of context BIBREF5 , BIBREF6 . We then train a paragraph vector model using the Document to Vector (Doc2Vec) framework BIBREF7 on the whole set (13 million) of preprocessed text records, although training on smaller sets (1 million) also produces good results. This training step is only done once. This Doc2Vec model is subsequently used to infer high-dimensional vector descriptions for the text of each of the 3229 documents in our target analysis set. We then compute a matrix containing pairwise similarities between any pair of document vectors, as inferred with Doc2Vec. This matrix can be thought of as a full, weighted graph with documents as nodes and edges weighted by their similarity. We sparsify this graph to the union of a minimum spanning tree and a k-Nearest Neighbors (MST-kNN) graph BIBREF8 , a geometric construction that removes less important similarities but preserves global connectivity for the graph and, hence, for the dataset. The derived MST-kNN graph is analysed with Markov Stability BIBREF9 , BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 , BIBREF12 , a multi-resolution dynamics-based graph partitioning method that identifies relevant subgraphs (i.e., clusters of documents) at different levels of granularity. MS uses a diffusive process on the graph to reveal the multiscale organisation at different resolutions without the need for choosing a priori the number of clusters, scale or organisation. To analyse a posteriori the different partitions across levels of resolution, we use both visualisations and quantitative scores. The visualisations include word clouds to summarise the main content, graph layouts, as well as Sankey diagrams and contingency tables that capture the correspondences across levels of resolution and relationships to the hand-coded classifications. The partitions are also evaluated quantitatively to score: (i) their intrinsic topic coherence (using pairwise mutual information BIBREF13 , BIBREF14 ), and (ii) their similarity to the operator hand-coded categories (using normalised mutual information BIBREF15 ). We now expand on the steps of the computational framework."

(We note that our target subset of 3229 records has been excluded from these samples.) Furthermore, we checked the importance of the specificity of the text corpus by obtaining a Doc2Vec model from a generic, non-specific set of 5 million articles from Wikipedia representing standard English usage across a variety of topics."

This was expected as the pre-trained Speech2Vec vectors have lower vocabulary coverage than GloVe. Yet, we observed that concatenating GloVe + Speech2Vec, and further GloVe + Word2Vec + Speech2Vec yields better NLU results: F1-score increased from 0.89 to 0.91 for intent recognition, from 0.96 to 0.97 for slot filling.",

We investigated the audio-visual feature additions on top of text-only and text+speech embedding models. Adding openSMILE/IS10 features from audio, as well as incorporating intermediate CNN/Inception-ResNet-v2 features from video brought slight improvements to our intent models, reaching 0.92 F1-score.

The difference of each model on the word analogy task is shown in Figure FIGREF16 in Section SECREF5. As the results of the ELMoForManyLangs embeddings are significantly worse than using the full corpus, we can conclude that these embeddings are not of sufficient quality.

The number of dimensions is set to 10 for the embeddings of POS tags, dependency labels and distance labels. We use the validation sets to tune the number of dimensions for these labels. For optimization, we rely on the cross-entropy loss function and Stochastic Gradient Descent with the Adadelta update rule BIBREF11 . For training, we use the Theano framework BIBREF12 .

It assigns larger weights $\\alpha _{t}$ to hidden states $h_{t}$ corresponding to positions, where there is more evidence that the tweet should be harassment (or any other specific type of harassment) or not. In our work we are using four attention mechanisms instead of one that is presented in BIBREF9. Particularly, we are using one attention mechanism per category.

Moreover, considering the type of the harassment, the tweets are divided into three sub-categories which are indirect harassment, sexual and physical harassment. We can see in Table TABREF1 the class distribution of our dataset. One important issue here is that the categories of indirect and physical harassment seem to be more rare in the train set than in the validation and test sets.

So, we actually include four models in our experiments (having a projected layer or not). Firstly, LastStateRNN is the classic RNN model, where the last state passes through an MLP and then the LR Layer estimates the corresponding probability. In contrast, in the AvgRNN model we consider the average vector of all states that come out of the cells. The AttentionRNN model is the one that it has been presented in BIBREF9. Moreover, we introduce the MultiAttentionRNN model for the harassment language detection, which instead of one attention, it includes four attentions, one for each category."

It was published for the \"First workshop on categorizing different types of online harassment languages in social media\". The whole dataset is divided into two categories, which are harassment and non-harassment tweets. Moreover, considering the type of the harassment, the tweets are divided into three sub-categories which are indirect harassment, sexual and physical harassment. We can see in Table TABREF1 the class distribution of our dataset. One important issue here is that the categories of indirect and physical harassment seem to be more rare in the train set than in the validation and test sets. To tackle this issue, as we describe in the next section, we are performing data augmentation techniques. However, the dataset is imbalanced and this has a significant impact in our results."

          "Figure FIGREF10 illustrates the UTCNN model. As more than one user may interact with a given post, we first add a maximum pooling layer after the user matrix embedding layer and user vector embedding layer to form a moderator matrix embedding INLINEFORM0 and a moderator vector embedding INLINEFORM1 for moderator INLINEFORM2 respectively, where INLINEFORM3 is used for the semantic transformation in the document composition process, as mentioned in the previous section. The term moderator here is to denote the pseudo user who provides the overall semantic/sentiment of all the engaged users for one document. The embedding INLINEFORM4 models the moderator stance preference, that is, the pattern of the revealed user stance: whether a user is willing to show his preference, whether a user likes to show impartiality with neutral statements and reasonable arguments, or just wants to show strong support for one stance. Ideally, the latent user stance is modeled by INLINEFORM5 for each user. Likewise, for topic information, a maximum pooling layer is added after the topic matrix embedding layer and topic vector embedding layer to form a joint topic matrix embedding INLINEFORM6 and a joint topic vector embedding INLINEFORM7 for topic INLINEFORM8 respectively, where INLINEFORM9 models the semantic transformation of topic INLINEFORM10 as in users and INLINEFORM11 models the topic stance tendency. The latent topic stance is also modeled by INLINEFORM12 for each topic.",
          "As for comments, we view them as short documents with authors only but without likers nor their own comments. Therefore we apply document composition on comments although here users are commenters (users who comment). It is noticed that the word embeddings INLINEFORM0 for the same word in the posts and comments are the same, but after being transformed to INLINEFORM1 in the document composition process shown in Figure FIGREF4 , they might become different because of their different engaged users. The output comment representation together with the commenter vector embedding INLINEFORM2 and topic vector embedding INLINEFORM3 are concatenated and a maximum pooling layer is added to select the most important feature for comments. Instead of requiring that the comment stance agree with the post, UTCNN simply extracts the most important features of the comment contents; they could be helpful, whether they show obvious agreement or disagreement. Therefore when combining comment information here, the maximum pooling layer is more appropriate than other pooling or merging layers. Indeed, we believe this is one reason for UTCNN's performance gains.",

          "The FBFans dataset contains data from anti-nuclear-power Chinese Facebook fan groups from September 2013 to August 2014, including posts and their author and liker IDs. There are a total of 2,496 authors, 505,137 likers, 33,686 commenters, and 505,412 unique users. Two annotators were asked to take into account only the post content to label the stance of the posts in the whole dataset as supportive, neutral, or unsupportive (hereafter denoted as Sup, Neu, and Uns). Sup/Uns posts were those in support of or against anti-reconstruction; Neu posts were those evincing a neutral standpoint on the topic, or were irrelevant. Raw agreement between annotators is 0.91, indicating high agreement. Specifically, Cohen’s Kappa for Neu and not Neu labeling is 0.58 (moderate), and for Sup or Uns labeling is 0.84 (almost perfect). Posts with inconsistent labels were filtered out, and the development and testing sets were randomly selected from what was left. Posts in the development and testing sets involved at least one user who appeared in the training set. The number of posts for each stance is shown on the left-hand side of Table TABREF12 . About twenty percent of the posts were labeled with a stance, and the number of supportive (Sup) posts was much larger than that of the unsupportive (Uns) ones: this is thus highly skewed data, which complicates stance classification. On average, 161.1 users were involved in one post. The maximum was 23,297 and the minimum was one (the author). For comments, on average there were 3 comments per post. The maximum was 1,092 and the minimum was zero.",

          "Our approach improves LR by 5.17% (Accuracy) and 18.38% (AUC), and MLP by 10.71% (Accuracy) and 30.27% (AUC) on average. Such significant improvements clearly demonstrate that our approach is effective at improving model performance. We observe that the target models generally converge between the 7th and 9th iteration on both datasets when performance is measured by AUC. The performance can slightly degrade when the models are further trained for more iterations on both datasets. This is likely due to the fact that over time, the newly discovered keywords entail lower novel information for model training. For instance, for the CyberAttack dataset the new keyword in the 9th iteration `election' frequently co-occurs with the keyword `russia' in the 5th iteration (in microposts that connect Russian hackers with US elections), thus bringing limited new information for improving the model performance. As a side remark, we note that the models converge faster when performance is measured by accuracy. Such a comparison result confirms the difference between the metrics and shows the necessity for more keywords to discriminate event-related microposts from non event-related ones."

Macaw consists of multiple actions, each action is a module that can satisfy the information needs of users for some requests. For example, search and question answering can be two actions in Macaw. Even multiple search algorithms can be also seen as multiple actions. Each action can produce multiple outputs (e.g., multiple retrieved documents). For every user interaction, Macaw runs all actions in parallel. The actions' outputs produced within a predefined time interval (i.e., an interaction timeout constant) are then post-processed. Macaw can choose one or combine multiple of these outputs and prepare an output Message object as the user's response."

The high-level overview of Macaw is depicted in FIGREF8. The user interacts with the interface and the interface produces a Message object from the current interaction of user. The interaction can be in multi-modal form, such as text, speech, image, and click. Macaw stores all interactions in an “Interaction Database”. For every interaction, Macaw looks for most recent user-system interactions (including the system's responses) to create a list of Messages, called the conversation list. It is then dispatched to multiple information seeking (and related) actions. The actions run in parallel, and each should respond within a pre-defined time interval. The output selection component selects from (or potentially combines) the outputs generated by different actions and creates a Message object as the system's response.

Each section in a Wikipedia entity page represents a different topic. For example, Barack Obama has the sections `Early Life', `Presidency', `Family and Personal Life' etc. However, many entity pages have an incomplete section structure. Incomplete or missing sections are due to two Wikipedia properties. First, long-tail entities miss information and sections due to their lack of popularity. Second, for all entities whether popular or not, certain sections might occur for the first time due to real world developments. As an example, the entity Germanwings did not have an `Accidents' section before this year's disaster, which was the first in the history of the airline.",

Although frequency of mention and positional features play some role in baseline features, their interaction is not modeled by a single feature nor do the positional features encode more than sentence position.

The decay corresponds to the positional index of the news paragraph. This is inspired by the news-specific discourse structure that tends to give short summaries of the most important facts and entities in the opening paragraphs. (iii) it compares entity frequency to the frequency of its co-occurring mentions as the weight of an entity appearing in a specific paragraph, normalized by the sum of the frequencies of other entities in INLINEFORM2 .

For the second case we construct the graph INLINEFORM3 consisting of entities in INLINEFORM4 and news articles in INLINEFORM5 as vertices.

For NER, token level BIO-tag probabilities are computed with a single output layer based on the representations from the last layer of BERT. We fine-tune the model on the entity recognition task during four training epochs with batch size $b=32$, dropout probability $d=0.1$ and learning rate $\\eta =2^{-5}$. These hyper-parameters are proposed by Devlin2018 for BERT fine-tuning."

          "The main obstacle for detecting suspicious Twitter accounts is due to the behavior of mixing some real news with the misleading ones. Consequently, we investigate ways to detect suspicious accounts by considering their tweets in groups (chunks). Our hypothesis is that suspicious accounts have a unique pattern in posting tweet sequences. Since their intention is to mislead, the way they transition from one set of tweets to the next has a hidden signature, biased by their intentions. Therefore, reading these tweets in chunks has the potential to improve the detection of the fake news accounts.",
          "Given a news Twitter account, we read its tweets from the account's timeline. Then we sort the tweets by the posting date in ascending way and we split them into $N$ chunks. Each chunk consists of a sorted sequence of tweets labeled by the label of its corresponding account. We extract a set of features from each chunk and we feed them into a recurrent neural network to model the sequential flow of the chunks' tweets. We use an attention layer with dropout to attend over the most important tweets in each chunk. Finally, the representation is fed into a softmax layer to produce a probability distribution over the account types and thus predict the factuality of the accounts. Since we have many chunks for each account, the label for an account is obtained by taking the majority class of the account's chunks."

( BIBREF12 ) acknowledged the similarities among prior work and discussed the need for a typology that differentiates between whether the (abusive) language is directed towards a specific individual or entity or towards a generalized group and whether the abusive content is explicit or implicit. Wiegand et al. ( BIBREF11 ) followed this trend as well on German tweets. In their evaluation, they have a task to detect offensive vs not offensive tweets and a second task for distinguishing between the offensive tweets as profanity, insult, or abuse. However, no prior work has explored the target of the offensive language, which is important in many scenarios, e.g., when studying hate speech with respect to a specific target."

We retrieved the data using the Twitter API by searching for keywords and constructions that are often included in offensive messages, such as `she is' or `to:BreitBartNews'. We carried out a first round of trial annotation of 300 instances with six experts. The goal of the trial annotation was to 1) evaluate the proposed tagset; 2) evaluate the data retrieval method; and 3) create a gold standard with instances that could be used as test questions in the training and test setting annotation which was carried out using crowdsourcing. The breakdown of keywords and their offensive content in the trial data of 300 tweets is shown in Table TABREF14 . We included a left (@NewYorker) and far-right (@BreitBartNews) news accounts because there tends to be political offense in the comments. One of the best offensive keywords was tweets that were flagged as not being safe by the Twitter `safe' filter (the `-' indicates `not safe'). The vast majority of content on Twitter is not offensive so we tried different strategies to keep a reasonable number of tweets in the offensive class amounting to around 30% of the dataset including excluding some keywords that were not high in offensive content such as `they are` and `to:NewYorker`. Although `he is' is lower in offensive content we kept it as a keyword to avoid gender bias. In addition to the keywords in the trial set, we searched for more political keywords which tend to be higher in offensive content, and sampled our dataset such that 50% of the the tweets come from political keywords and 50% come from non-political keywords. In addition to the keywords `gun control', and `to:BreitbartNews', political keywords used to collect these tweets are `MAGA', `antifa', `conservative' and `liberal'. We computed Fliess' INLINEFORM0 on the trial set for the five annotators on 21 of the tweets. INLINEFORM1 is .83 for Layer A (OFF vs NOT) indicating high agreement. As to normalization and anonymization, no user metadata or Twitter IDs have been stored, and URLs and Twitter mentions have been substituted to placeholders. We follow prior work in related areas (burnap2015cyber,davidson2017automated) and annotate our data using crowdsourcing using the platform Figure Eight. We ensure data quality by: 1) we only received annotations from individuals who were experienced in the platform; and 2) we used test questions to discard annotations of individuals who did not reach a certain threshold. Each instance in the dataset was annotated by multiple annotators and inter-annotator agreement has been calculated. We first acquired two annotations for each instance. In case of 100% agreement, we considered these as acceptable annotations, and in case of disagreement, we requested more annotations until the agreement was above 66%. After the crowdsourcing annotation, we used expert adjudication to guarantee the quality of the annotation.

Larger number of overlaps, suggest that the candidate summary has higher content quality with respect to the gold-standard. This method, enables us to also reward for terms that are not lexically equivalent but semantically related. Our method is based on the well established linguistic premise that semantically related words occur in similar contexts BIBREF5 . The context of the words can be considered as surrounding words, sentences in which they appear or the documents. For scientific summarization, we consider the context of the words as the scientific articles in which they appear. Thus, if two concepts appear in identical set of articles, they are semantically related. We consider the two summaries as similar if they refer to same set of articles even if the two summaries do not have high lexical overlaps. To capture if a summary relates to a article, we use information retrieval by considering the summaries as queries and the articles as documents and we rank the articles based on their relatedness to a given summary. For a given pair of system summary and the gold summary, similar rankings of the retrieved articles suggest that the summaries are semantically related, and thus the system summary is of higher quality."

To accomplish this, we use the summaries as search queries and compare the overlaps of the retrieved results. Larger number of overlaps, suggest that the candidate summary has higher content quality with respect to the gold-standard. This method, enables us to also reward for terms that are not lexically equivalent but semantically related. Our method is based on the well established linguistic premise that semantically related words occur in similar contexts BIBREF5 . The context of the words can be considered as surrounding words, sentences in which they appear or the documents. For scientific summarization, we consider the context of the words as the scientific articles in which they appear. Thus, if two concepts appear in identical set of articles, they are semantically related. We consider the two summaries as similar if they refer to same set of articles even if the two summaries do not have high lexical overlaps. To capture if a summary relates to a article, we use information retrieval by considering the summaries as queries and the articles as documents and we rank the articles based on their relatedness to a given summary. For a given pair of system summary and the gold summary, similar rankings of the retrieved articles suggest that the summaries are semantically related, and thus the system summary is of higher quality."

Interestingly, we observe that many variants of Rouge scores do not have high correlations with human pyramid scores. The lowest F-score correlations are for Rouge-1 and Rouge-L (with INLINEFORM0 =0.454). Weak correlation of Rouge-1 shows that matching unigrams between the candidate summary and gold summaries is not accurate in quantifying the quality of the summary. On higher order n-grams, however, we can see that Rouge correlates better with pyramid. In fact, the highest overall INLINEFORM1 is obtained by Rouge-3. Rouge-L and its weighted version Rouge-W, both have weak correlations with pyramid. Skip-bigrams (Rouge-S) and its combination with unigrams (Rouge-SU) also show sub-optimal correlations. Note that INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 correlations are more reliable in our setup due to the small sample size."

In particular, we raise the important question of how effective is Rouge, as an evaluation metric for scientific summarization? We answer this question by comparing Rouge scores with semi-manual evaluation score (Pyramid) in TAC 2014 scientific summarization dataset[1]. Results reveal that, contrary to the common belief, correlations between Rouge and the Pyramid scores are weak, which challenges its effectiveness for scientific summarization. Furthermore, we show a large variance of correlations between different Rouge variants and the manual evaluations which further makes the reliability of Rouge for evaluating scientific summaries less clear. We then propose an evaluation metric based on relevance analysis of summaries which aims to overcome the limitation of high lexical dependence in Rouge. We call our metric Sera (Summarization Evaluation by Relevance Analysis). Results show that the proposed metric achieves higher and more consistent correlations with semi-manual assessment scores."

According to our results, the simple LSTM network and the MemN2N perform very poorly on this dataset. Especially on the most advanced reasoning tasks. Indeed, the task 5 which corresponds to the prediction of the exact rating of an aspect seems to be very challenging for these model. Maybe the tokenization by sentence to create the memory blocks of the MemN2N, which is appropriated in the case of the bAbI tasks, is not a good representation of the documents when it has to handle human generated comments. However, the logistic regression achieves reasonable performance on these tasks, and do not suffer from catastrophic performance on any tasks. Its worst result comes on task 6 and one of the reason is probably that this architecture is not designed to predict a list of answers. On the contrary, the deep projective reader achieves encouraging on this dataset. It outperforms all the other baselines, with very good scores on the first fourth tasks. The question/document and document/document attention layers proposed in BIBREF12 seem once again to produce rich encodings of the inputs which are relevant for our projection layer."

The idea is to use a translation model that will translate our human-generated questions into another language, and then translate them back to English. This double translation will introduce rewordings of the questions that we will be able to integrate into this dataset. This approach has been used in BIBREF7 to perform data augmentation on the training set. For this purpose, we have trained a fairseq BIBREF19 model to translate sentences from English to French and for French to English. In order to preserve the quality of the sentences we have so far, we only keep the most probable translation of each original sentence. Indeed a beam search is used during the translation to predict the most probable translations which mean that we each translation comes with an associated probability. By selecting only the first translations, we almost double the number of questions without degrading the quality of the questions proposed in the dataset."

Compared with statistical machine translation models (PBMT-R, Hybrid, SBMT-SARI), our method (NMT+synthetic) still have better results, but slightly worse FKGL and SARI. Similar to the results in WikiLarge, the results of our human evaluation using Simplicity outperforms the other models. In conclusion, Our method produces better results comparing with the baselines, which demonstrates the effectiveness of adding simplified training data."

          "Methods. We use OpenNMT BIBREF24 as the implementation of the NMT system for all experiments BIBREF5 . We generally follow the default settings and training procedure described by Klein et al.(2017). We replace out-of-vocabulary words with a special UNK symbol. At prediction time, we replace UNK words with the highest probability score from the attention layer. OpenNMT system used on parallel data is the baseline system. To obtain a synthetic parallel training set, we back-translate a random sample of 100K sentences from the collected simplified corpora. OpenNMT used on parallel data and synthetic data is our model. The benchmarks are run on a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-5930K CPU@3.50GHz, 32GB Mem, trained on 1 GPU GeForce GTX 1080 (Pascal) with CUDA v. 8.0.",
          "We choose three statistical text simplification systems. PBMT-R is a phrase-based method with a reranking post-processing step BIBREF18 . Hybrid performs sentence splitting and deletion operations based on discourse representation structures, and then simplifies sentences with PBMT-R BIBREF25 . SBMT-SARI BIBREF19 is syntax-based translation model using PPDB paraphrase database BIBREF26 and modifies tuning function (using SARI). We choose two neural text simplification systems. NMT is a basic attention-based encoder-decoder model which uses OpenNMT framework to train with two LSTM layers, hidden states of size 500 and 500 hidden units, SGD optimizer, and a dropout rate of 0.3 BIBREF8 . Dress is an encoder-decoder model coupled with a deep reinforcement learning framework, and the parameters are chosen according to the original paper BIBREF20 . For the experiments with synthetic parallel data, we back-translate a random sample of 60 000 sentences from the collected simplified sentences into ordinary sentences. Our model is trained on synthetic data and the available parallel data, denoted as NMT+synthetic."

As the figure shows, sports and politics are most dominant for offensive language including vulgar and hate speech. As for dialect, we looked at MSA and four major dialects, namely Egyptian (EGY), Leventine (LEV), Maghrebi (MGR), and Gulf (GLF). Figure FIGREF14 shows that 71% of vulgar tweets were written in EGY followed by GLF, which accounted for 13% of vulgar tweets. MSA was not used in any of the vulgar tweets. As for offensive tweets in general, EGY and GLF were used in 36% and 35% of the offensive tweets respectively. Unlike the case of vulgar language where MSA was non-existent, 15% of the offensive tweets were in fact written in MSA. For hate speech, GLF and EGY were again dominant and MSA consistuted 21% of the tweets. This is consistent with findings for other languages such as English and Italian where vulgar language was more frequently associated with colloquial language BIBREF24, BIBREF25. Regarding the gender, Figure FIGREF15 shows that the vast majority of offensive tweets, including vulgar and hate speech, were authored by males. Female Twitter users accounted for 14% of offensive tweets in general and 6% and 9% of vulgar and hate speech respectively. Figure FIGREF16 shows a detailed categorization of hate speech types, where the top three include insulting groups based on their political ideology, origin, and sport affiliation. Religious hate speech appeared in only 15% of all hate speech tweets."

Such language is often associated with undesirable online behaviors such as trolling, cyberbullying, online extremism, political polarization, and propaganda. Thus, offensive language detection is instrumental for a variety of application such as: quantifying polarization BIBREF0, BIBREF1, trolls and propaganda account detection BIBREF2, detecting the likelihood of hate crimes BIBREF3; and predicting conflict BIBREF4. In this paper, we describe our methodology for building a large dataset of Arabic offensive tweets. Given that roughly 1-2% of all Arabic tweets are offensive BIBREF5, targeted annotation is essential for efficiently building a large dataset. Since our methodology does not use a seed list of offensive words, it is not biased by topic, target, or dialect. Using our methodology, we tagged 10,000 Arabic tweet dataset for offensiveness, where offensive tweets account for roughly 19% of the tweets. Further, we labeled tweets as vulgar or hate speech. To date, this is the largest available dataset, which we plan to make publicly available along with annotation guidelines. We use this dataset to characterize Arabic offensive language to ascertain the topics, dialects, and users' gender that are most associated with the use of offensive language. Though we suspect that there are common features that span different languages and cultures, some characteristics of Arabic offensive language is language and culture specific. Thus, we conduct a thorough analysis of how Arabic users use offensive language. Next, we use the dataset to train strong Arabic offensive language classifiers using state-of-the-art representations and classification techniques. Specifically, we experiment with static and contextualized embeddings for representation along with a variety of classifiers such as a deep neural network classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM)."

          "Although some previous studies focus on irony detection, little attention is paid to irony generation. As ironies can strengthen sentiments and express stronger emotions, we mainly focus on generating ironic sentences. Given a non-ironic sentence, we implement a neural network to transfer it to an ironic sentence and constrain the sentiment polarity of the two sentences to be the same. For example, the input is “I hate it when my plans get ruined\" which is negative in sentiment polarity and the output should be ironic and negative in sentiment as well, such as “I like it when my plans get ruined\". The speaker uses “like\" to be ironic and express his or her negative sentiment. At the same time, our model can preserve contents which are irrelevant to sentiment polarity and irony. According to the categories mentioned in BIBREF5 , irony can be classified into 3 classes: verbal irony by means of a polarity contrast, the sentences containing expression whose polarity is inverted between the intended and the literal evaluation; other types of verbal irony, the sentences that show no polarity contrast between the literal and intended meaning but are still ironic; and situational irony, the sentences that describe situations that fail to meet some expectations. As ironies in the latter two categories are obscure and hard to understand, we decide to only focus on ironies in the first category in this work. For example, our work can be specifically described as: given a sentence “I hate to be ignored\", we train our model to generate an ironic sentence such as “I love to be ignored\".

However, the only high-quality irony dataset we can obtain is the dataset of Semeval-2018 Task 3 and the dataset is pretty small, which will cause overfitting to complex models. Therefore, we just implement a simple one-layer RNN with LSTM cell to classify pre-processed sentences into ironic sentences and non-ironic sentences because LSTM networks are widely used in irony detection. We train the model with the dataset of Semeval-2018 Task 3. After classification, we get 262,755 ironic sentences and 399,775 non-ironic sentences. According to our observation, not all non-ironic sentences are suitable to be transferred into ironic sentences. For example, “just hanging out . watching . is it monday yet\" is hard to transfer because it does not have an explicit sentiment polarity. So we remove all interrogative sentences from the non-ironic sentences and only obtain the sentences which have words expressing strong sentiments. We evaluate the sentiment polarity of each word with TextBlob and we view those words with sentiment scores greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5 as words expressing strong sentiments. Finally, we build our irony dataset with 262,755 ironic sentences and 102,330 non-ironic sentences."

Then, due to the lack of parallel data, we propose a novel model to transfer non-ironic sentences to ironic sentences in an unsupervised way. As ironic style is hard to model and describe, we implement our model with the control of classifiers and reinforcement learning. Different from other studies in style transfer, the transformation from non-ironic to ironic sentences has to preserve sentiment polarity as mentioned above. Therefore, we not only design an irony reward to control the irony accuracy and implement denoising auto-encoder and back-translation to control content preservation but also design a sentiment reward to control sentiment preservation."

This outcome may be due to the common use of some terms when expressing positive stance towards sports clubs in Turkish tweets. The same percentage of common terms may not have been observed in tweets during the expression of negative stances towards the targets. Yet, completely the opposite pattern is observed in stance detection results of baseline systems given in BIBREF0 , i.e., better F-Measure rates have been obtained for the Against class when compared with the Favor class BIBREF0 . Some of the baseline systems reported in BIBREF0 are SVM-based systems using unigrams and ngrams as features similar to our study, but their data sets include all three stance classes of Favor, Against, and Neither, while our data set comprises only tweets classified as belonging to Favor or Against classes. Another difference is that the data sets in BIBREF0 have been divided into training and test sets, while in our study we provide 10-fold cross-validation results on the whole data set. On the other hand, we should also note that SVM-based sentiment analysis systems (such as those given in BIBREF16 ) have been reported to achieve better F-Measure rates for the Positive sentiment class when compared with the results obtained for the Negative class. Therefore, our evaluation results for each stance class seem to be in line with such sentiment analysis systems.

However, long texts such news articles often describe multiple events which clearly violates this assumption; (2) During the inference process of both approaches, the Gibbs sampler needs to compute the conditional posterior distribution and assigns an event for each document.

Top N terms were selected and added to our dictionary where N=100k for higher count emotions joy, sadness, anger, love and N=50k for thankfulness and fear and N=25k for surprise. Seven binary classifiers were trained for the seven emotions with a batch size of 250 and for 20 epochs with binary cross-entropy as the objective function and Adam optimizer. The architecture of the model can be seen in Figure FIGREF6 . For training each classifier, a balanced dataset was created with selecting all tweets from the target set as class 1 and a random sample of the same size from other classes as class 0. For each classifier, 80% of the data was randomly selected as the training set, and 10% for the validation set, and 10% as the test set. As mentioned before we used the two embedding models, ConceptNet Numberbatch and fastText as the two more modern pre-trained word vector spaces to see how changing the embedding layer can affect the performance. The result of comparison among different embeddings can be seen in Table TABREF10 . It can be seen that the best performance was divided between the two embedding models with minor performance variations.",

Let's see an example: we may be a baseball fan but unfamiliar with hockey so that we can provide a few number of feature words of baseball, but much less of hockey for a baseball-hockey classification task. Such prior knowledge may mislead the model with heavy bias to baseball. If the model cannot handle this situation appropriately, the performance may be undesirable.",

The study aims to reveal the factors of reducing the sensibility of the prior knowledge and therefore to make the model more robust and practical. To this end, we introduce auxiliary regularization terms in which our prior knowledge is formalized as distribution over output variables. Recall the example just mentioned, though we do not have enough knowledge to provide features for class hockey, it is easy for us to provide some neutral words, namely words that are not strong indicators of any class, like player here. As one of the factors revealed in this paper, supplying neutral feature words can boost the performance remarkably, making the model more robust."

We join all arguments in the extracted n-ary relation into a sequence as our to the point context. Figure FIGREF5 shows n-ary relations extracted from OpenIE. As we can see, OpenIE extracts multiple relations for complex sentences. Here we select the most informative relation according to three criteria in the order of descending importance: (1) having the maximal number of overlapped tokens between the answer and the relation; (2) being assigned the highest confidence score by OpenIE; (3) containing maximum non-stop words.

After a hyperparameter search, we selected the model with the best performance on the A1 development set. Then, using the hyperparameters selected from this search, we created a final set of models by training several models with different random seeds. During annotation, we constructed an ensemble by randomly picking a model from the model set as the adversary each turn. This helps us avoid annotators exploiting vulnerabilities in one single model. A new non-overlapping set of contexts was again constructed from Wikipedia via HotpotQA using the same method as Round 1.",

          "A promising strategy to bridge the gap mentioned above is to integrate the neural networks of MRC models with the general knowledge of human beings. To this end, it is necessary to solve two problems: extracting general knowledge from passage-question pairs and utilizing the extracted general knowledge in the prediction of answer spans. The first problem can be solved with knowledge bases, which store general knowledge in structured forms. A broad variety of knowledge bases are available, such as WordNet BIBREF7 storing semantic knowledge, ConceptNet BIBREF8 storing commonsense knowledge, and Freebase BIBREF9 storing factoid knowledge. In this paper, we limit the scope of general knowledge to inter-word semantic connections, and thus use WordNet as our knowledge base. The existing way to solve the second problem is to encode general knowledge in vector space so that the encoding results can be used to enhance the lexical or contextual representations of words BIBREF10 , BIBREF11 . However, this is an implicit way to utilize general knowledge, since in this way we can neither understand nor control the functioning of general knowledge. In this paper, we discard the existing implicit way and instead explore an explicit (i.e. understandable and controllable) way to utilize general knowledge.",
          "WordNet is a lexical database of English, where words are organized into synsets according to their senses. A synset is a set of words expressing the same sense so that a word having multiple senses belongs to multiple synsets, with each synset corresponding to a sense. Synsets are further related to each other through semantic relations. According to the WordNet interface provided by NLTK BIBREF12 , there are totally sixteen types of semantic relations (e.g. hypernyms, hyponyms, holonyms, meronyms, attributes, etc.). Based on synset and semantic relation, we define a new concept: semantic relation chain. A semantic relation chain is a concatenated sequence of semantic relations, which links a synset to another synset. For example, the synset “keratin.n.01” is related to the synset “feather.n.01” through the semantic relation “substance holonym”, the synset “feather.n.01” is related to the synset “bird.n.01” through the semantic relation “part holonym”, and the synset “bird.n.01” is related to the synset “parrot.n.01” through the semantic relation “hyponym”, thus “substance holonym INLINEFORM0 part holonym INLINEFORM1 hyponym” is a semantic relation chain, which links the synset “keratin.n.01” to the synset “parrot.n.01”. We name each semantic relation in a semantic relation chain as a hop, therefore the above semantic relation chain is a 3-hop chain. By the way, each single semantic relation is equivalent to a 1-hop chain."

On the one hand, developing MRC models requires a large amount of training examples (i.e. the passage-question pairs labeled with answer spans), while human beings can achieve good performance on evaluation examples (i.e. the passage-question pairs to address) without training examples. On the other hand, BIBREF6 revealed that intentionally injected noise (e.g. misleading sentences) in evaluation examples causes the performance of MRC models to drop significantly, while human beings are far less likely to suffer from this. The reason for these phenomena, we believe, is that MRC models can only utilize the knowledge contained in each given passage-question pair, but in addition to this, human beings can also utilize general knowledge. A typical category of general knowledge is inter-word semantic connections. As shown in Table TABREF1 , such general knowledge is essential to the reading comprehension ability of human beings."

Example (1) uses a hashtag `#WontGiveItBack' which was trending during the ICC cricket world cup 2015. Searching it on Google gave 435k results and the time of the tweet was after the final match of the tournament. So there is an observational humor in (1) as India won the world cup in 2011 and lost in 2015 , hence the tweet was classified as humorous. Any tweets stating any facts, news or reality were classified as non-humorous. There were many tweets which did not contain any hashtags, to understand the context of such tweets annotators selected some keywords from the tweet and searched them online. Example (2) contains a comment towards a political leader towards development and was categorized as non-humorous. Tweets containing normal jokes and funny quotes like in (3) and (4) were put in humorous category. There were some tweets like (5) which consists of poem or lines of a song but modified. Annotators were guided that if such tweets contains satire or any humoristic features, then it could be categorized as humorous otherwise not. There were some tweets which were typical to categorize like (5), hence it was left to the annotators to the best of their understanding. Based on the above guidelines annotators categorized the tweets. To measure inter annotator agreement we opted for Fleiss' Kappa BIBREF12 obtaining an agreement of 0.821 . Both humorous and non-humorous tweets in nearly balanced amount were selected to prepare the corpus. If we had included humorous tweets from one domain like sports and non humorous tweets from another domain like news then, it would have given high performance of classification BIBREF13 . To classify based on the semantics and not on the domain differences, we included both types of tweets from different domains. Many tweets contains a picture along with a caption. Sometimes a caption may not contain humor but combined with the picture, it can provide some degree of humor. Such tweets were removed from the corpus to make the corpus unimodal. In Figure 1, the first tweet, “Anurag Kashyap can never join AAP because ministers took oath `main kisi Anurag aur dwesh ke bina kaam karunga' ” (Anurag Kashyap can never join AAP because ministers took oath `I will work without any affection (Anurag in Hindi) and without hesitation (dwesh in Hindi)'), was classified as humorous. The second tweet, “#SakshiMalik take a bow! #proudIndian #Rio #Olympics #BronzeMedal #girlpower Hamaara khaata khul Gaya!” (#SakshiMalik take a bow! #proudIndian #Rio #Olympics #BronzeMedal #girlpower Our account opened!) was classified as non-humorous as it contains a pride statement."

Since Waseem et al.BIBREF5 created a small ad-hoc set of keywords and Davidson et al.BIBREF9 used a large crowdsourced dictionary of keywords (Hatebase lexicon) to sample tweets for training, they included some biases in the collected data. Especially for Davidson-dataset, some tweets with specific language (written within the African American Vernacular English) and geographic restriction (United States of America) are oversampled such as tweets containing disparage words “nigga\", “faggot\", “coon\", or “queer\", result in high rates of misclassification. However, these misclassifications do not confirm the low performance of our classifier because annotators tended to annotate many samples containing disrespectful words as hate or offensive without any presumption about the social context of tweeters such as the speaker’s identity or dialect, whereas they were just offensive or even neither tweets. Tweets IDs 6, 8, and 10 are some samples containing offensive words and slurs which arenot hate or offensive in all cases and writers of them used this type of language in their daily communications. Given these pieces of evidence, by considering the content of tweets, we can see in tweets IDs 3, 4, and 9 that our BERT-based classifier can discriminate tweets in which neither and implicit hatred content exist. One explanation of this observation may be the pre-trained general knowledge that exists in our model. Since the pre-trained BERT model is trained on general corpora, it has learned general knowledge from normal textual data without any purposely hateful or offensive language. Therefore, despite the bias in the data, our model can differentiate hate and offensive samples accurately by leveraging knowledge-aware language understanding that it has and it can be the main reason for high misclassifications of hate samples as offensive (in reality they are more similar to offensive rather than hate by considering social context, geolocation, and dialect of tweeters)."

          "Especially after the introduction of the word2vec algorithm by Mikolov BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , there has been a growing interest in algorithms that generate improved word representations under some performance metric. Significant effort is spent on appropriately modifying the objective functions of the algorithms in order to incorporate knowledge from external resources, with the purpose of increasing the performance of the resulting word representations BIBREF28 , BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 , BIBREF33 , BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 , BIBREF36 , BIBREF37 . Inspired by the line of work reported in these studies, we propose to use modified objective functions for a different purpose: learning more interpretable dense word embeddings. By doing this, we aim to incorporate semantic information from an external lexical resource into the word embedding so that the embedding dimensions are aligned along predefined concepts. This alignment is achieved by introducing a modification to the embedding learning process. In our proposed method, which is built on top of the GloVe algorithm BIBREF2 , the cost function for any one of the words of concept word-groups is modified by the introduction of an additive term to the cost function. Each embedding vector dimension is first associated with a concept. For a word belonging to any one of the word-groups representing these concepts, the modified cost term favors an increase for the value of this word's embedding vector dimension corresponding to the concept that the particular word belongs to. For words that do not belong to any one of the word-groups, the cost term is left untouched. Specifically, Roget's Thesaurus BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 is used to derive the concepts and concept word-groups to be used as the external lexical resource for our proposed method. We quantitatively demonstrate the increase in interpretability by using the measure given in BIBREF27 , BIBREF40 as well as demonstrating qualitative results. We also show that the semantic structure of the original embedding has not been harmed in the process since there is no performance loss with standard word-similarity or word-analogy tests.",
          "By using the concept word-groups, we have trained the GloVe algorithm with the proposed modification given in Section SECREF4 on a snapshot of English Wikipedia measuring 8GB in size, with the stop-words filtered out. Using the parameters given in Table TABREF10 , this resulted in a vocabulary size of 287,847. For the weighting parameter in Eq. SECREF4 , we used a value of INLINEFORM0 . The algorithm was trained over 20 iterations. The GloVe algorithm without any modifications was also trained as a baseline with the same parameters. In addition to the original GloVe algorithm, we compare our proposed method with previous studies that aim to obtain interpretable word vectors. We train the improved projected gradient model proposed in BIBREF20 to obtain word vectors (called OIWE-IPG) using the same corpus we use to train GloVe and our proposed method. Using the methods proposed in BIBREF23 , BIBREF26 , BIBREF24 on our baseline GloVe embeddings, we obtain SOV, SPINE and Parsimax (orthogonal) word representations, respectively. We train all the models with the proposed parameters. However, in BIBREF26 , the authors show results for a relatively small vocabulary of 15,000 words. When we trained their model on our baseline GloVe embeddings with a large vocabulary of size 287,847, the resulting vectors performed significantly poor on word similarity tasks compared to the results presented in their paper. In addition, Parsimax (orthogonal) word vectors obtained using method in BIBREF26 are nearly identical to the baseline vectors (i.e. learned orthogonal transformation matrix is very close to identity). Therefore, Parsimax (orthogonal) yields almost same results with baseline vectors in all evaluations. We evaluate the interpretability of the resulting embeddings qualitatively and quantitatively. We also test the performance of the embeddings on word similarity and word analogy tests."

          "Especially after the introduction of the word2vec algorithm by Mikolov BIBREF0 , BIBREF1 , there has been a growing interest in algorithms that generate improved word representations under some performance metric. Significant effort is spent on appropriately modifying the objective functions of the algorithms in order to incorporate knowledge from external resources, with the purpose of increasing the performance of the resulting word representations BIBREF28 , BIBREF29 , BIBREF30 , BIBREF31 , BIBREF32 , BIBREF33 , BIBREF34 , BIBREF35 , BIBREF36 , BIBREF37 . Inspired by the line of work reported in these studies, we propose to use modified objective functions for a different purpose: learning more interpretable dense word embeddings. By doing this, we aim to incorporate semantic information from an external lexical resource into the word embedding so that the embedding dimensions are aligned along predefined concepts. This alignment is achieved by introducing a modification to the embedding learning process. In our proposed method, which is built on top of the GloVe algorithm BIBREF2 , the cost function for any one of the words of concept word-groups is modified by the introduction of an additive term to the cost function. Each embedding vector dimension is first associated with a concept. For a word belonging to any one of the word-groups representing these concepts, the modified cost term favors an increase for the value of this word's embedding vector dimension corresponding to the concept that the particular word belongs to. For words that do not belong to any one of the word-groups, the cost term is left untouched. Specifically, Roget's Thesaurus BIBREF38 , BIBREF39 is used to derive the concepts and concept word-groups to be used as the external lexical resource for our proposed method. We quantitatively demonstrate the increase in interpretability by using the measure given in BIBREF27 , BIBREF40 as well as demonstrating qualitative results.

          "Motivation: In recent times, building representation models based on supervision from richly structured resources such as Paraphrase Database (PPDB) BIBREF19 (containing noisy phrase pairs) has yielded high quality sentence representations. These methods work by maximizing the similarity of the sentences in the learned semantic space.",
          "Models: Skip-thought vectors BIBREF15 (STV) is a widely popular sentence encoder, which is trained to predict adjacent sentences in the book corpus BIBREF16 . Although the testing is cheap as it involves a cheap forward propagation of the test sentence, STV is very slow to train thanks to its complicated model architecture. To combat this computational inefficiency, FastSent BIBREF17 propose a simple additive (log-linear) sentence model, which predicts adjacent sentences (represented as BOW) taking the BOW representation of some sentence in context. This model can exploit the same signal, but at a much lower computational expense. Parallel to this work, Siamase CBOW BIBREF18 develop a model which directly compares the BOW representation of two sentence to bring the embeddings of a sentence closer to its adjacent sentence, away from a randomly occurring sentence in the corpus. For FastSent and Siamese CBOW, the test sentence representation is a simple average of word vectors obtained after training. Both of these models are general purpose sentence representation models trained on book corpus, yet give a competitive performance over previous models on the tweet semantic similarity computation task. BIBREF14 's model attempt to exploit these signals directly from Twitter. With the help of attention technique and learned user representation, this log-linear model is able to capture salient semantic information from chronologically adjacent tweets of a target tweet in users' Twitter timeline."

We observe that the layer of mentions alone conveys useful information for the classification, denoting a different usage of this functionality when sharing news belonging to the two news domains. We also show that most discriminative features, which are relative to the breadth and depth of largest cascades in different layers, are the same across the two countries."

          "Note that the number of fields in the infobox and the ordering of the fields within the infobox varies from person to person. Given the large size (700K examples) and heterogeneous nature of the dataset which contains biographies of people from different backgrounds (sports, politics, arts, etc.), it is hard to come up with simple rule-based templates for generating natural language descriptions from infoboxes, thereby making a case for data-driven models. Based on the recent success of data-driven neural models for various other NLG tasks BIBREF1 , BIBREF2 , BIBREF3 , BIBREF4 , BIBREF5 , one simple choice is to treat the infobox as a sequence of {field, value} pairs and use a standard seq2seq model for this task. However, such a model is too generic and does not exploit the specific characteristics of this task as explained below. First, note that while generating such descriptions from structured data, a human keeps track of information at two levels. Specifically, at a macro level, she would first decide which field to mention next and then at a micro level decide which of the values in the field needs to be mentioned next. For example, she first decides that at the current step, the field occupation needs attention and then decides which is the next appropriate occupation to attend to from the set of occupations (actor, director, producer, etc.). To enable this, we use a bifocal attention mechanism which computes an attention over fields at a macro level and over values at a micro level. We then fuse these attention weights such that the attention weight for a field also influences the attention over the values within it. Finally, we feed a fused context vector to the decoder which contains both field level and word level information. Note that such two-level attention mechanisms BIBREF6 , BIBREF7 , BIBREF8 have been used in the context of unstructured data (as opposed to structured data in our case), where at a macro level one needs to pay attention to sentences and at a micro level to words in the sentences.",

To capture this behavior, we use a bifocal attention mechanism as described below.",

          "Third (our primary contribution), we propose a task-agnostic defense, attaching a word recognition model that predicts each word in a sentence given a full sequence of (possibly misspelled) inputs. The word recognition model's outputs form the input to a downstream classification model. Our word recognition models build upon the RNN-based semi-character word recognition model due to BIBREF7 . While our word recognizers are trained on domain-specific text from the task at hand, they often predict UNK at test time, owing to the small domain-specific vocabulary. To handle unobserved and rare words, we propose several backoff strategies including falling back on a generic word recognizer trained on a larger corpus. Incorporating our defenses, BERT models subject to 1-character attacks are restored to $88.3$ , $81.1$ , $78.0$ accuracy for swap, drop, add attacks respectively, as compared to $69.2$ , $63.6$ , and $50.0$ for adversarial training",

For English, they report an F1 score of 83.6% (PU=87.5%, CO=80.1%), but note that our English results are not directly comparable to theirs due to differences argument identification, as discussed in section SECREF25 . As their argument identification score is lower, perhaps their system is discarding “difficult” arguments which leads to a higher clustering score."

On the contrary, the combination of the two best performing similarity-based approaches INLINEFORM2 and INLINEFORM3 does not yield better accuracy. The negative impact of using a lower-performing approach such as INLINEFORM4 within a hybrid combination can also be observed in INLINEFORM5 for lower values of INLINEFORM6 . Overall, this confirms our initial intuition that combining the best performing popularity-based approach with the best similarity-based approach should result in the highest accuracy (i.e., INLINEFORM7 for INLINEFORM8 ). Moreover, our goal, namely to exploit editor tags in combination with search terms used by readers to increase the metadata quality of e-books, is shown to be best supported by applying hybrid approaches as they provide the best prediction results."

This part can also serve for Persian ASR training. Each part is described in more details below. Table TABREF11 shows the number of unique phrases in each part of the database.

The rows in Table TABREF13 corresponds to the different experimental setups and shows the numbers of speakers in each set. Note that, for English, we have filtered the (Persian native) speakers by the ability to read English. Therefore, there are fewer speakers in each set for English than for Persian. There is a small “dev” set in each setup which can be used for parameter tuning to prevent over-tuning on the evaluation set.",

However, different strategy is used for defining trials: Depending on the enrollment condition (1- to 3-sess), trials are enrolled on utterances of all words from 1 to 3 different sessions (i.e. 3 to 9 utterances). Further, we consider two conditions for test utterances: seq test utterance with only 3 or 4 words and full test utterances with all words (i.e. same words as in enrollment but in different order). From all setups an all conditions, the 100-spk with 1-session enrolment (1-sess) is considered as the main evaluation condition for the text-prompted case. In Table TABREF16, the numbers of trials (sum for both seq and full conditions) for Persian 1-sess are shown for the different types of trials in the text-prompted SV.

Models using word embeddings trained on the discharge summaries performed better than word embeddings trained on all MIMIC notes, likely because the discharge summary word embeddings better captured word use in discharge summaries alone. Interestingly, the continuous bag of words embeddings outperformed skip gram embeddings, which is surprising because the skip gram architecture typically works better for infrequent words BIBREF26 . As expected, inclusion of character embeddings increases performance by approximately 3%. The model with word embeddings learned in the model achieves the highest performance on the dev set (0.886), which may be because the pretrained worm embeddings were trained on a previous version of MIMIC.

In order to understand this finding, we visualize each dataset using PCA (Figure FIGREF17 ). It depicts that, although Dataset 1 is mostly linearly separable, Dataset 3 is not. A linear kernel that performs well on Dataset 1 fails to provide good performance on Dataset 3. If we use RBF kernel, it overfits the data and produces worse results than what we get using linear kernel. Similar trends are seen in the performance of other two state-of-the-art approaches BIBREF9 , BIBREF8 . Thus, we decide to perform training on Dataset 3 and test on the Dataset 1. As expected better performance is obtained with F1-score 76.78%. However, the other two state-of-the-art approaches fail to perform well in this setting. While the method by BIBREF9 obtains F1-score of 47.32%, the approach by BIBREF8 achieves 53.02% F1-score when trained on Dataset 3 and tested on Dataset 1.

The baseline features ( SECREF16 ) perform best among other features. Among all the pre-trained models, the sentiment model (F1-score: 87.00%) achieves better performance in comparison with the other two pre-trained models. Interestingly, when we merge the baseline features with the features extracted by the pre-trained deep NLP models, we only get 0.11% improvement over the F-score. It means that the baseline features alone are quite capable to detect sarcasm. On the other hand, when we combine sentiment, emotion and personality features, we obtain 90.70% F1-score. This indicates that the pre-trained features are indeed useful for sarcasm detection. We also compare our approach with the best research study conducted on this dataset (Table TABREF30 ). Both the proposed baseline model and the baseline + sentiment + emotion + personality model outperform the state of the art BIBREF9 , BIBREF8 . One important difference with the state of the art is that BIBREF8 used relatively larger feature vector size ( INLINEFORM0 500,000) than we used in our experiment (1,100). This not only prevents our model to overfit the data but also speeds up the computation. Thus, we obtain an improvement in the overall performance with automatic feature extraction using a relatively lower dimensional feature space."

          "The effect of this multiplication is exemplified in Figure FIGREF7, showing the positions of word vectors in the VSM. Those “x\" words are sentimentally negative words, those “o\" words are sentimentally positive ones. On the top coordinate plane, the words of opposite polarities are found to be close to each other, since they have common words in their dictionary definitions. Only the information concerned with the dictionary definitions are used there, discarding the polarity scores. However, when we utilise the supervised score (+1 or -1), words of opposite polarities (e.g. “happy\" and “unhappy\") get far away from each other as they are translated across coordinate regions. Positive words now appear in quadrant 1, whereas negative words appear in quadrant 3. Thus, in the VSM, words that are sentimentally similar to each other could be clustered more accurately. Besides clustering, we also employed the SVD method to perform dimensionality reduction on the unsupervised dictionary algorithm and used the newly generated matrix by combining it with other subapproaches. The number of dimensions is chosen as 200 again according to the $U$ matrix. The details are given in Section 3.4. When using and evaluating this subapproach on the English corpora, we used the SentiWordNet lexicon BIBREF13. We have achieved better results for the dictionary-based algorithm when we employed the SVD reduction method compared to the use of clustering."

The inorganic behavior analysis falls inline with behavior contagion, where the followers tend to adapt to the behavior of their opinion leaders. The “Chowkidar movement” showed a similar effect in the #LokSabhaElectios2019, which was evident by how the other political leaders and followers of BJP party added chowkidar to their profile attributes after @narendramodi did.

Rather than naively obtaining tweets from Twitter using the Twitter API which can yield irrelevant tweets with no valuable information, we restrict ourselves only to tweets which have been used by journalists in news articles thus implicitly implying that such tweets contain useful and relevant information. To obtain such relevant tweets, we crawled thousands of news articles that include tweet quotations and then employed crowd-sourcing to elicit questions and answers based on these event-aligned tweets. Table TABREF3 gives an example from our TweetQA dataset. It shows that QA over tweets raises challenges not only because of the informal nature of oral-style texts (e.g. inferring the answer from multiple short sentences, like the phrase “so young” that forms an independent sentence in the example), but also from tweet-specific expressions (such as inferring that it is “Jay Sean” feeling sad about Paul's death because he posted the tweet).",
          "After we retrieve the QA pairs from all HITs, we conduct further post-filtering to filter out the pairs from workers that obviously do not follow instructions. We remove QA pairs with yes/no answers. Questions with less than five words are also filtered out. This process filtered INLINEFORM0 of the QA pairs. The dataset now includes 10,898 articles, 17,794 tweets, and 13,757 crowdsourced question-answer pairs. The collected QA pairs will be directly available to the public, and we will provide a script to download the original tweets and detailed documentation on how we build our dataset. Also note that since we keep the original news article and news titles for each tweet, our dataset can also be used to explore more challenging generation tasks. Table TABREF19 shows the statistics of our current collection, and the frequency of different types of questions is shown in Table TABREF21 . All QA pairs were written by 492 individual workers."

          "One major challenge of building a QA dataset on tweets is the sparsity of informative tweets. Many users write tweets to express their feelings or emotions about their personal lives. These tweets are generally uninformative and also very difficult to ask questions about. Given the linguistic variance of tweets, it is generally hard to directly distinguish those tweets from informative ones. In terms of this, rather than starting from Twitter API Search, we look into the archived snapshots of two major news websites (CNN, NBC), and then extract the tweet blocks that are embedded in the news articles. In order to get enough data, we first extract the URLs of all section pages (e.g. World, Politics, Money, Tech) from the snapshot of each home page and then crawl all articles with tweets from these section pages. Note that another possible way to collect informative tweets is to download the tweets that are posted by the official Twitter accounts of news media. However, these tweets are often just the summaries of news articles, which are written in formal text. As our focus is to develop a dataset for QA on informal social media text, we do not consider this approach."

The deep learning systems benefit highly from a large quantity of labeled training data. Our first and basic speech recognition system is trained on 17000 hours of Shenma voice search dataset. It is a generic dataset sampled from diverse aspects of search queries. The requirement of speech recognition system also addressed by specific scenario, such as map and navigation task. The labeled dataset is too expensive, and training a new model with new large dataset from the beginning costs lots of time. Thus, it is natural to think of transferring the knowledge from basic model to new scenario's model. Transfer learning expends less data and less training time than full training. In this paper, we also introduce a novel transfer learning strategy with segmental Minimum Bayes-Risk (sMBR). As a result, transfer training with only 1000 hours data can match equivalent performance for full training with 7300 hours data."

Each token is then passed through a word-embedding layer that converts a word index to a corresponding 300-dimensional vector that contains additional contextual meaning between words. The sequence of embedded tokens is fed into a text recurrent encoder (TRE) in such a way that the audio MFCC features are encoded using the ARE represented by equation EQREF2 .

          "We examine the WAP values, which are shown in Table 1. First, our ARE model shows the baseline performance because we use minimal audio features, such as the MFCC and prosodic features with simple architectures. On the other hand, the TRE model shows higher performance gain compared to the ARE. From this result, we note that textual data are informative in emotion prediction tasks, and the recurrent encoder model is effective in understanding these types of sequential data. Second, the newly proposed model, MDRE, shows a substantial performance gain. It thus achieves the state-of-the-art performance with a WAP value of 0.718. This result shows that multimodal information is a key factor in affective computing. Lastly, the attention model, MDREA, also outperforms the best existing research results (WAP 0.690 to 0.688) BIBREF19 . However, the MDREA model does not match the performance of the MDRE model, even though it utilizes a more complex architecture. We believe that this result arises because insufficient data are available to properly determine the complex model parameters in the MDREA model. Moreover, we presume that this model will show better performance when the audio signals are aligned with the textual sequence while applying the attention mechanism. We leave the implementation of this point as a future research direction."

They consist of two LSTM networks, for propagating text forward and backwards with the goal being to capture the dependencies better.

An interesting perspective might be to further constrain the model on the data structure in order to prevent inaccurate of even contradictory descriptions."

          "It is worth reflecting on the nature of the shared task dataset (PTC corpus) and its structural correspondence (or lack thereof) to some of the definitions of propaganda mentioned in the introduction. First, propaganda is a social phenomenon and takes place as an act of communication BIBREF19, and so it is more than a simple information-theoretic message of zeros and ones—it also incorporates an addresser and addressee(s), each in phatic contact (typically via broadcast media), ideally with a shared denotational code and contextual surround(s) BIBREF20.",

          "As such, a dataset of decontextualised documents with labelled sentences, devoid of authorial or publisher metadata, has taken us at some remove from even a simple everyday definition of propaganda. Our models for this shared task cannot easily incorporate information about the addresser or addressee; are left to assume a shared denotational code between author and reader (one perhaps simulated with the use of pre-trained word embeddings); and they are unaware of when or where the act(s) of propagandistic communication took place. This slipperiness is illustrated in our example document (Fig. FIGREF13): note that while Sentences 3 and 7, labelled as propaganda, reflect a propagandistic attitude on the part of the journalist and/or publisher, Sentence 4—also labelled as propaganda in the training data—instead reflects a “flag-waving\" propagandistic attitude on the part of U.S. congressman Jeff Flake, via the conventions of reported speech BIBREF21. While reported speech often is signaled by specific morphosyntactic patterns (e.g. the use of double-quotes and “Flake said\") BIBREF22, we argue that human readers routinely distinguish propagandistic reportage from the propagandastic speech acts of its subjects, and to conflate these categories in a propaganda detection corpus may contribute to the occurrence of false positives/negatives."

          "So as to better understand the aspects of oversampling that contribute to these gains, we perform a class-wise performance analysis of BERT with/without oversampling. The results of these experiments (Table TABREF18) show that oversampling increases the overall recall while maintaining precision. This is achieved by significantly improving the recall of the minority class (propaganda) at the cost of the recall of the majority class.",
          "We explore the validity of this by performing several experiments with different weights assigned to the minority class. We note that in our experiments use significantly higher weights than the weights proportional to class frequencies in the training data, that are common in literature BIBREF17. Rather than directly using the class proportions of the training set, we show that tuning weights based on performance on the development set is more beneficial. Figure FIGREF22 shows the results of these experiments wherein we are able to maintain the precision on the subset of the training set used for testing while reducing its recall and thus generalising the model. The fact that the model is generalising on a dissimilar dataset is confirmed by the increase in the development set F1 score. We note that the gains are not infinite and that a balance must be struck based on the amount of generalisation and the corresponding loss in accuracy. The exact weight to use for the best transfer of classification accuracy is related to the dissimilarity of that other dataset and hence is to be obtained experimentally through hyperparameter search. Our experiments showed that a value of 4 is best suited for this task."

Most newspapers, including the New York Times, almost exclusively used the word homosexual in articles about gay and lesbian people until the late 1980s BIBREF53. The New York Times began using the word gay in non-quoted text in 1987. Many major newspapers began restricting the use of the word homosexual in 2006 BIBREF52. As of 2013, the New York Times has confined the use of homosexual to specific references to sexual activity or clinical orientation, in addition to direct quotes and paraphrases ."

          "We evaluated summarization quality automatically using ROUGE BIBREF32. We report unigram and bigram overlap (ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2) as a means of assessing informativeness and the longest common subsequence (ROUGE-L) as a means of assessing fluency. Table TABREF23 summarizes our results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset. The first block in the table includes the results of an extractive Oracle system as an upper bound. We also present the Lead-3 baseline (which simply selects the first three sentences in a document). The second block in the table includes various extractive models trained on the CNN/DailyMail dataset (see Section SECREF5 for an overview). For comparison to our own model, we also implemented a non-pretrained Transformer baseline (TransformerExt) which uses the same architecture as BertSumExt, but with fewer parameters. It is randomly initialized and only trained on the summarization task. TransformerExt has 6 layers, the hidden size is 512, and the feed-forward filter size is 2,048. The model was trained with same settings as in BIBREF3. The third block in Table TABREF23 highlights the performance of several abstractive models on the CNN/DailyMail dataset (see Section SECREF6 for an overview). We also include an abstractive Transformer baseline (TransformerAbs) which has the same decoder as our abstractive BertSum models; the encoder is a 6-layer Transformer with 768 hidden size and 2,048 feed-forward filter size. The fourth block reports results with fine-tuned Bert models: BertSumExt and its two variants (one without interval embeddings, and one with the large version of Bert), BertSumAbs, and BertSumExtAbs. Bert-based models outperform the Lead-3 baseline which is not a strawman; on the CNN/DailyMail corpus it is indeed superior to several extractive BIBREF7, BIBREF8, BIBREF19 and abstractive models BIBREF6. Bert models collectively outperform all previously proposed extractive and abstractive systems, only falling behind the Oracle upper bound. Among Bert variants, BertSumExt performs best which is not entirely surprising; CNN/DailyMail summaries are somewhat extractive and even abstractive models are prone to copying sentences from the source document when trained on this dataset BIBREF6. Perhaps unsurprisingly we observe that larger versions of Bert lead to performance improvements and that interval embeddings bring only slight gains. Table TABREF24 presents results on the NYT dataset. Following the evaluation protocol in BIBREF27, we use limited-length ROUGE Recall, where predicted summaries are truncated to the length of the gold summaries. Again, we report the performance of the Oracle upper bound and Lead-3 baseline. The second block in the table contains previously proposed extractive models as well as our own Transformer baseline. Compress BIBREF27 is an ILP-based model which combines compression and anaphoricity constraints. The third block includes abstractive models from the literature, and our Transformer baseline. Bert-based models are shown in the fourth block. Again, we observe that they outperform previously proposed approaches. On this dataset, abstractive Bert models generally perform better compared to BertSumExt, almost approaching Oracle performance.",

Recall that summaries in this dataset are highly abstractive (see Table TABREF12) consisting of a single sentence conveying the gist of the document. Extractive models here perform poorly as corroborated by the low performance of the Lead baseline (which simply selects the leading sentence from the document), and the Oracle (which selects a single-best sentence in each document) in Table TABREF26. As a result, we do not report results for extractive models on this dataset. The second block in Table TABREF26 presents the results of various abstractive models taken from BIBREF22 and also includes our own abstractive Transformer baseline.

Using Adaboost, our LOSS+GOSS features outperform all other features except for UFN which is 2% higher than ours with regard to precision on the Honeypot dataset. It is caused by the incorrectly classified spammers who are mostly news source after our manual check. They keep posting all kinds of news pieces covering diverse topics, which is similar to the behavior of fake accounts. However, UFN based on friendship networks is more useful for public accounts who possess large number of followers. The best recall value of our LOSS+GOSS features using SVM is up to 6% higher than the results by other feature groups. Regarding F1-score, our features outperform all other features. To further show the advantages of our proposed features, we compare our combined LOSS+GOSS with the combination of all the features from Lee et al. lee2011seven (UFN+UC+UH). It's obvious that LOSS+GOSS have a great advantage over UFN+UC+UH in terms of recall and F1-score. Moreover, by combining our LOSS+GOSS features and UFN+UC+UH features together, we obtained another 7.1% and 2.3% performance gain with regard to precision and F1-score by Adaboost. Though there is a slight decline in terms of recall. By SVM, we get comparative results on recall and F1-score but about 3.5% improvement on precision."

We also conduct two human evaluations in order to assess (a) which type of summary participants prefer (we compare extractive and abstractive systems) and (b) how much key information from the document is preserved in the summary (we ask participants to answer questions pertaining to the content in the document by reading system summaries). Both evaluations overwhelmingly show that human subjects find our summaries more informative and complete."

          "(1) We propose extended middle context, a new context representation for CNNs for relation classification. The extended middle context uses all parts of the sentence (the relation arguments, left of the relation arguments, between the arguments, right of the arguments) and pays special attention to the middle part.",
          "One of our contributions is a new input representation especially designed for relation classification. The contexts are split into three disjoint regions based on the two relation arguments: the left context, the middle context and the right context. Since in most cases the middle context contains the most relevant information for the relation, we want to focus on it but not ignore the other regions completely. Hence, we propose to use two contexts: (1) a combination of the left context, the left entity and the middle context; and (2) a combination of the middle context, the right entity and the right context. Due to the repetition of the middle context, we force the network to pay special attention to it. The two contexts are processed by two independent convolutional and max-pooling layers. After pooling, the results are concatenated to form the sentence representation. Figure FIGREF3 depicts this procedure. It shows an examplary sentence: “He had chest pain and <e1>headaches</e1> from <e2>mold</e2> in the bedroom.” If we only considered the middle context “from”, the network might be tempted to predict a relation like Entity-Origin(e1,e2). However, by also taking the left and right context into account, the model can detect the relation Cause-Effect(e2,e1). While this could also be achieved by integrating the whole context into the model, using the whole context can have disadvantages for longer sentences: The max pooling step can easily choose a value from a part of the sentence which is far away from the mention of the relation. With splitting the context into two parts, we reduce this danger. Repeating the middle context increases the chance for the max pooling step to pick a value from the middle context."

We adopt a personalized approach to understanding privacy policies, that allows users to query a document and selectively explore content salient to them. Most similar is the PolisisQA corpus BIBREF29, which examines questions users ask corporations on Twitter. Our approach differs in several ways: 1) The PrivacyQA dataset is larger, containing 10x as many questions and answers. 2) Answers are formulated by domain experts with legal training. 3) PrivacyQA includes diverse question types, including unanswerable and subjective questions."

We focus on social media posts from the website Twitter, which are an excellent testing ground for character based models due to the noisy nature of text. Heavy use of slang and abundant misspellings means that there are many orthographically and semantically similar tokens, and special characters such as emojis are also immensely popular and carry useful semantic information. In our moderately sized training dataset of 2 million tweets, there were about 0.92 million unique word types. It would be expensive to capture all these phenomena in a word based model in terms of both the memory requirement (for the increased vocabulary) and the amount of training data required for effective learning. Additional benefits of the character based approach include language independence of the methods, and no requirement of NLP preprocessing such as word-segmentation."

We further combine the two into a joint model. We perform experiments on two datasets: a Wikipedia dataset novel to this paper, and an arXiv dataset provided by BIBREF2 split into three sub-parts based on subject category. Experimental results on the visual renderings of documents show that implicit quality indicators, such as images and visual layout, can be captured by an image classifier, at a level comparable to a text classifier. When we combine the two models, we achieve state-of-the-art results over 3/4 of our datasets.",

Experimental results show that we achieve a 2.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art approaches based on textual features over Wikipedia, and performance competitive with or surpassing state-of-the-art approaches over arXiv.

Note that only the GloVe word vectors are used as word representations, as opposed to some models that introduce character-level features. It is also notable that our proposed architecture does not restrict the selection of pooling method; the performance could further be improved by replacing max-pooling with other advanced algorithms e.g. intra-sentence attention BIBREF39 and generalized pooling BIBREF19 ."

          "Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Classical Arabic (CA) have two types of vowels, namely long vowels, which are explicitly written, and short vowels, aka diacritics, which are typically omitted in writing but are reintroduced by readers to properly pronounce words. Since diacritics disambiguate the sense of the words in context and their syntactic roles in sentences, automatic diacritic recovery is essential for applications such as text-to-speech and educational tools for language learners, who may not know how to properly verbalize words. Diacritics have two types, namely: core-word (CW) diacritics, which are internal to words and specify lexical selection; and case-endings (CE), which appear on the last letter of word stems, typically specifying their syntactic role. For example, the word “ktb” (كتب>) can have multiple diacritized forms such as “katab” (كَتَب> – meaning “he wrote”) “kutub” (كُتُب> – “books”). While “katab” can only assume one CE, namely “fatHa” (“a”), “kutub” can accept the CEs: “damma” (“u”) (nominal – ex. subject), “a” (accusative – ex. object), “kasra” (“i”) (genitive – ex. PP predicate), or their nunations. There are 14 diacritic combinations. When used as CEs, they typically convey specific syntactic information, namely: fatHa “a” for accusative nouns, past verbs and subjunctive present verbs; kasra “i” for genitive nouns; damma “u” for nominative nouns and indicative present verbs; sukun “o” for jussive present verbs and imperative verbs. FatHa, kasra and damma can be preceded by shadda “$\\sim $” for gemination (consonant doubling) and/or converted to nunation forms following some grammar rules. In addition, according to Arabic orthography and phonology, some words take a virtual (null) “#” marker when they end with certain characters (ex: long vowels). This applies also to all non-Arabic words (ex: punctuation, digits, Latin words, etc.). Generally, function words, adverbs and foreign named entities (NEs) have set CEs (sukun, fatHa or virtual). Similar to other Semitic languages, Arabic allows flexible Verb-Subject-Object as well as Verb-Object-Subject constructs BIBREF1. Such flexibility creates inherent ambiguity, which is resolved by diacritics as in “r$>$Y Emr Ely” (رأى عمر علي> Omar saw Ali/Ali saw Omar). In the absence of diacritics it is not clear who saw whom. Similarly, in the sub-sentence “kAn Alm&tmr AltAsE” (كان المؤتمر التاسع>), if the last word, is a predicate of the verb “kAn”, then the sentence would mean “this conference was the ninth” and would receive a fatHa (a) as a case ending. Conversely, if it was an adjective to the “conference”, then the sentence would mean “the ninth conference was ...” and would receive a damma (u) as a case ending. Thus, a consideration of context is required for proper disambiguation. Due to the inter-word dependence of CEs, they are typically harder to predict compared to core-word diacritics BIBREF2, BIBREF3, BIBREF4, BIBREF5, with CEER of state-of-the-art systems being in double digits compared to nearly 3% for word-cores. Since recovering CEs is akin to shallow parsing BIBREF6 and requires morphological and syntactic processing, it is a difficult problem in Arabic NLP. In this paper, we focus on recovering both CW diacritics and CEs. We employ two separate Deep Neural Network (DNN) architectures for recovering both kinds of diacritic types. We use character-level and word-level bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (biLSTM) based recurrent neural models for CW diacritic and CE recovery respectively. We train models for both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Classical Arabic (CA). For CW diacritics, the model is informed using word segmentation information and a unigram language model. We also employ a unigram language model to perform post correction on the model output. We achieve word error rates for CW diacritics of 2.9% and 2.2% for MSA and CA. The MSA word error rate is 6% lower than the best results in the literature (the RDI diacritizer BIBREF7). The CE model is trained with a rich set of surface, morphological, and syntactic features. The proposed features would aid the biLSTM model in capturing syntactic dependencies indicated by Part-Of-Speech (POS) tags, gender and number features, morphological patterns, and affixes. We show that our model achieves a case ending error rate (CEER) of 3.7% for MSA and 2.5% for CA. For MSA, this CEER is more than 60% lower than other state-of-the-art systems such as Farasa and the RDI diacritizer, which are trained on the same dataset and achieve CEERs of 10.7% and 14.4% respectively.

We show that modelling the thread structure and the sequence of posts explicitly improves performance. Instructors in different MOOCs from different subject areas intervene differently. For example, on a Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) MOOC, instructors may often intervene early as possible to resolve misunderstanding of the subject material and prevent confusion. However, in a Humanities MOOC, instructors allow for the students to explore open-ended discussions and debate among themselves. Such instructors may prefer to intervene later in the discussion to encourage further discussion or resolve conflicts among students. We therefore propose attention models to infer the latent context, i.e., the series of posts that trigger an intervention. Earlier studies on MOOC forum intervention either model the entire context or require the context size to be specified explicitly."

Second, from the model running on the KP20k validation set, we randomly sample 2000 decoder hidden states at INLINEFORM4 steps following a delimiter ( INLINEFORM5 ) and apply an unsupervised clustering method (t-SNE BIBREF35 ) on them. From the Figure FIGREF46 we can see that hidden states sampled from INLINEFORM6 are easier to cluster while hidden states sampled from INLINEFORM7 yield one mass of vectors with no obvious distinct clusters. Results on both metrics suggest target encoding and orthogonal regularization indeed help diversifying generation of our model.",

          "Labeled data are input into the model to calculate the standard supervised loss for each mini-batch and the model weights are updated regularly. Meanwhile, each mini-batch of unlabeled data is selected randomly from the pool of all unlabeled data; the model computes the loss for CVT from the mini-batch of unlabeled data. This CVT loss is used to train auxiliary prediction modules, which see restricted views of the input, to match the output of the primary prediction module, which is the full model that sees all the input. Meanwhile, the auxiliary prediction modules share the same intermediate representation with the primary prediction module. Hence, the intermediate representation of the model is improved through this process.",

Thus, we construct both types of prediction modules for our model. The flow of unlabeled data, which is processed to obtain a prediction by each module, is shown in Fig. . The output of each prediction module is transformed into the probability distribution of each class by the softmax function and then used to calculate INLINEFORM0 , as shown in cvtloss.

This as a whole forms a pipeline that takes in an image and outputs a poem as shown on the top left of Figure FIGREF4. A CNN-RNN generative model acts as an agent. The parameters of this agent define a policy whose execution determines which word is selected as an action. When the agent selects all words in a poem, it receives a reward. Two discriminative networks, shown on the top right of Figure FIGREF4, are defined to serve as rewards concerning whether the generated poem properly describes the input image and whether the generated poem is poetic.

This allows a one-to-one comparison of the exploration efficiency between Go-Explore and algorithms that use a count-based reward in text-based games. Importantly, BIBREF8 showed that DQN and DRQN, without such counting rewards, could never find a successful trajectory in hard games such as the ones used in our experiments. Figure FIGREF17 shows the number of interactions with the environment (frames) versus the maximum score obtained, averaged over 10 games of the same difficulty. As shown by BIBREF8, DRQN++ finds a trajectory with the maximum score faster than to DQN++. On the other hand, phase 1 of Go-Explore finds an optimal trajectory with approximately half the interactions with the environment. Moreover, the trajectory length found by Go-Explore is always optimal (i.e. 30 steps) whereas both DQN++ and DRQN++ have an average length of 38 and 42 respectively.",
          "In CookingWorld, we compared models in the three settings mentioned earlier, namely, single, joint, and zero-shot. In all experiments, we measured the sum of the final scores of all the games and their trajectory length (number of steps). Table TABREF26 summarizes the results in these three settings. Phase 1 of Go-Explore on single games achieves a total score of 19,530 (sum over all games), which is very close to the maximum possible points (i.e. 19,882), with 47,562 steps. A winning trajectory was found in 4,279 out of the total of 4,440 games. This result confirms again that the exploration strategy of Go-Explore is effective in text-based games. Next, we evaluate the effectiveness and the generalization ability of the simple imitation learning policy trained using the extracted trajectories in phase 1 of Go-Explore in the three settings mentioned above.",
          "In this setting, each model is trained from scratch in each of the 4,440 games based on the trajectory found in phase 1 of Go-Explore (previous step). As shown in Table TABREF26, the LSTM-DQN BIBREF7, BIBREF8 approach without the use of admissible actions performs poorly. One explanation for this could be that it is difficult for this model to explore both language and game strategy at the same time; it is hard for the model to find a reward signal before it has learned to model language, since almost none of its actions will be admissible, and those reward signals are what is necessary in order to learn the language model. As we see in Table TABREF26, however, by using the admissible actions in the $\\epsilon $-greedy step the score achieved by the LSTM-DQN increases dramatically (+ADM row in Table TABREF26). DRRN BIBREF10 achieves a very high score, since it explicitly learns how to rank admissible actions (i.e. a much simpler task than generating text). Finally, our approach of using a Seq2Seq model trained on the single trajectory provided by phase 1 of Go-Explore achieves the highest score among all the methods, even though we do not use admissible actions in this phase. However, in this experiment the Seq2Seq model cannot perfectly replicate the provided trajectory and the total score that it achieves is in fact 9.4% lower compared to the total score achieved by phase 1 of Go-Explore. Figure FIGREF61 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows the score breakdown for each level and model, where we can see that the gap between our model and other methods increases as the games become harder in terms of skills needed.",
          "In this setting the 4,440 games are split into training, validation, and test games. The split is done randomly but in a way that different difficulty levels (recipes 1, 2 and 3), are represented with equal ratios in all the 3 splits, i.e. stratified by difficulty. As shown in Table TABREF26, the zero-shot performance of the RL baselines is poor, which could be attributed to the same reasons why RL baselines under-perform in the Joint case. Especially interesting is that the performance of DRRN is substantially lower than that of the Go-Explore Seq2Seq model, even though the DRRN model has access to the admissible actions at test time, while the Seq2Seq model (as well as the LSTM-DQN model) has to construct actions token-by-token from the entire vocabulary of 20,000 tokens. On the other hand, Go-Explore Seq2Seq shows promising results by solving almost half of the unseen games. Figure FIGREF62 (in Appendix SECREF60) shows that most of the lost games are in the hardest set, where a very long sequence of actions is required for winning the game. These results demonstrate both the relative effectiveness of training a Seq2Seq model on Go-Explore trajectories, but they also indicate that additional effort needed for designing reinforcement learning algorithms that effectively generalize to unseen games."

For the experiments in this paper we mainly focus on the final performance of our policy, not how that policy is trained, thus making Go-Explore a suitable algorithm for our experiments. Go-Explore is composed of two phases. In phase 1 (also referred to as the “exploration” phase) the algorithm explores the state space through keeping track of previously visited states by maintaining an archive. During this phase, instead of resuming the exploration from scratch, the algorithm starts exploring from promising states in the archive to find high performing trajectories. In phase 2 (also referred to as the “robustification” phase, while in our variant we will call it “generalization”) the algorithm trains a policy using the trajectories found in phase 1. Following this framework, which is also shown in Figure FIGREF56 (Appendix A.2), we define the Go-Explore phases for text-based games."

Indeed, the heuristic-based synonym approach can sometimes harm the model performance (e.g., SST-5 and IMDB), as also observed in previous work BIBREF19, BIBREF18.

After removing duplicate tweets and tweets with fewer than ten tokens, this resulted in a set of 58.7 million tweets, containing 1.1 billion tokens.

The word embeddings were created using word2vec in the gensim library BIBREF3 , using CBOW, a window size of 40 and a minimum count of 5.

(a) For a batch of visual questions, our system first produces a relative ordering using the predicted confidence in whether a crowd would agree on an answer (upper half). Then, the system allocates a minimum number of annotations to all visual questions (bottom, left half) and then the extra available human budget to visual questions most confidently predicted to lead to crowd disagreement (bottom, right half). (b) For 121,512 visual questions, we show results for our system, a related VQA algorithm, and today’s status quo of random predictions. Boundary conditions are one answer (leftmost) and five answers (rightmost) for all visual questions. Our approach typically accelerates the capture of answer diversity by over 20% from today’s Status Quo selection; e.g., 21% for 70% of the answer diversity and 23% for 86% of the answer diversity. This translates to saving over 19 40-hour work weeks and $1800, assuming 30 seconds and $0.02 per answer."

The sequence-to-sequence model consists of a recurrent neural network (RNN) encoder that encodes the dialogue history and a decoder RNN which outputs natural language. Furthermore, the NUS generates its own goal and possibly changes it during a dialogue. This allows the model to be deployed for training more sophisticated DM policies. To achieve this, a method is proposed that transforms the goal-labels of the used dataset (DSTC2) into labels whose behaviour can be replicated during deployment."

Through this representation, most of the variability of the class is retained. Consequently, a word subspace can effectively and compactly represent the context of the corresponding text.

Here we are referring to all the notes data from MIMIC-III (NOTEEVENTS table ) and Case Reports articles from PubMed, as these contents are close to medical notes. To create the test set, we first followed the approach by BIBREF6 who applied an auto-generating method. Initially, we built a term-sense dictionary from the training dataset. Then we did matching for the sense words or phrases in the MIMIC-III notes dataset, and once there is a match, we replaced the words or phrases with the abbreviation term . We then asked two researchers with a medical background to check the matched samples manually with the following judgment: given this sentence and the abbreviation term and its sense, do you think the content is enough for you to guess the sense and whether this is the right sense? To estimate the agreement on the annotations, we selected a subset which contains 120 samples randomly and let the two annotators annotate individually. We got a Kappa score BIBREF27 of 0.96, which is considered as a near perfect agreement. We then distributed the work to the two annotators, and each of them labeled a half of the dataset, which means each sample was only labeled by a single annotator. For some rare term-sense pairs, we failed to find samples from MIMIC-III. The annotators then searched these senses via PubMed data source manually, aiming to find clinical notes-like sentences. They picked good sentences from these results as testing samples where the keywords exist and the content is informative. For those senses that are extremely rare, we let the annotators create sentences in the clinical note style as testing samples according to their experiences. Eventually, we have a balanced testing dataset, where each term-sense pair has around 15 samples for testing (on average, each pair has 14.56 samples and the median sample number is 15), and a comparison with training dataset is shown in Figure FIGREF11. Due to the difficulty for collecting the testing dataset, we decided to only collect for a random selection of 30 terms. On average, it took few hours to generate testing samples for each abbreviation term per researcher."

However, after carefully reviewing this dataset, we found that it contains many samples where medical professionals disagree: wrong samples and uncategorized samples. Due to these mistakes and flaws of this dataset, we removed the erroneous samples and eventually selected 30 abbreviation terms as our training dataset that can be made public. Among all the abbreviation terms, we have 11,466 samples, and 93 term-sense pairs in total (on average 123.3 samples/term-sense pair and 382.2 samples/term). Some term-sense pairs are very popular with a larger number of training samples but some are not (typically less than 5), we call them rare-sense cases .

          "As pointed out by the CSA report BIBREF1, women presence tends to be marginal within the high-audience hours, showing that women are represented but less than men and within certain given conditions. It is clear that a small number of speakers is responsible for a large number of speech turns. Most of these speakers are journalists, politicians, presenters and such, who are representative of a show. Therefore, we introduce the notion of speaker's role to refine our exploration of gender disparity, following studies which quantified women's presence in terms of role. Within our work, we define the notion of speaker role by two criteria specifying the speaker's on-air presence, namely the number of speech turns and the cumulative duration of his or her speaking time in a show. Based on the available speech transcriptions and meta-data, we compute for each speaker the number of speech turns uttered as well as their total length. We then use the following criteria to define speaker's role: a speaker is considered as speaking often (respectively seldom) if he/she accumulates a total of turns higher (respectively lower) than 1% of the total number of speech turns in a given show. The same process is applied to identify speakers talking for a long period from those who do not. We end up with two salient roles called Anchors and Punctual speakers:",
          "the Anchor speakers (A) are above the threshold of 1% for both criteria, meaning they are intervening often and for a long time thus holding an important place in interaction;",
          "the Punctual speakers (PS) on the contrary are below the threshold of 1% for both the total number of turns and the total speech time."

The scarceness of available corpora is justified by the fact that gathering and annotating audio data is costly both in terms of money and time. Telephone conversations and broadcast recordings have been the primary source of spontaneous speech used. Out of all the 130 audio resources proposed by LDC to train automatic speech recognition systems in English, approximately 14% of them are based on broadcast news and conversation. For French speech technologies, four corpora containing radio and TV broadcast are the most widely used: ESTER1 BIBREF13, ESTER2 BIBREF14, ETAPE BIBREF15 and REPERE BIBREF16.

In fact, I have been unable to construct any sentence in English that is translated into any language using the feminine plural pronun. Note that, since the masculine plural pronoun is used for groups of mixed gender in all these languages, it is almost certainly more common in text than the feminine plural; hence this strategy is reasonable faute de mieux.

          "If these sentences are translated into French, then `they' in the first sentence should be translated `elles', as referring to Jane and Susan, and `they' in the second sentence should be translated `ils', as referring to Fred and George.",
          "A couple of examples: The word `sie' in German serves as both the formal second person prounoun (always capitalized), the third person feminine singular, and the third person plural. Therefore, it can be translated into English as either “you”, “she”, “it”, or “they”; and into French as either `vous', `il', `elle', `ils', or `elles'. (The feminine third-person singular German `sie' can be translated as neuter in English and as masculine in French because the three languages do not slice up the worlds into genders in the same way.) Likewise, the possessive pronoun `ihr' in all its declensions can mean either `her' or `their'. In some cases, the disambiguation can be carried out on purely syntactic ground; e.g. if `sie' is the subject of a third-person singular verb, it must mean `she'. However, in many case, the disambiguation requires a deeper level of understanding. Thus, it should be possible to construct German Winograd schemas based on the words `sie' or `ihr' that have to be solved in order to translate them into English. For example,"

          "What may be more surprising is that currently (July 2016), machine translation programs are unable to choose the feminine plural pronoun even when the only possible antecedent is a group of women. For instance, the sentence “The girls sang a song and they danced” is translated into French as “Les filles ont chanté une chanson et ils ont dansé” by Google Translate (GT), Bing Translate, and Yandex. In fact, I have been unable to construct any sentence in English that is translated into any language using the feminine plural pronun. Note that, since the masculine plural pronoun is used for groups of mixed gender in all these languages, it is almost certainly more common in text than the feminine plural; hence this strategy is reasonable faute de mieux. (It also seems likely that the erroneous use of a feminine plural for a masculine antecedent sounds even more jarring than the reverse.)",
          "The same thing sometimes occurs in translating the feminine plural pronoun between languages that have it. GT translates the French word `elles' into Spanish as `ellos' (the masculine form). Curiously, in the opposite direction, it gets the right answer; the Spanish `ellas' (fem.) is translated into French as `elles'.",
          "The masculine and feminine plural pronouns are distinguished in the Romance languages (French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese etc.) and in Semitic languages (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.) I have consulted with native speakers and experts in these languages about the degree to which the gender distinction is observed in practice. The experts say that in French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, the distinction is very strictly observed; the use of a masculine pronoun for a feminine antecedent is jarringly wrong to a native or fluent speaker. “Les filles ont chanté une chanson et ils ont dansé” sounds as wrong to a French speaker as “The girl sang a song and he danced” sounds to an English speaker; in both cases, the hearer will interpret the pronoun as referrinig to some other persons or person, who is male. In Hebrew and Arabic, this is much less true; in speech, and even, increasingly, in writing, the masculine pronoun is often used for a feminine antecedent."

          "One straightforward way of sharing information on Twitter is by using the retweet functionality, which enables a user to share a exact copy of a tweet with his followers. Among the reasons for retweeting, Body et al. BIBREF15 reported the will to: 1) spread tweets to a new audience, 2) to show one’s role as a listener, and 3) to agree with someone or validate the thoughts of others. As indicated, our initial interest is to characterize tweets containing fake news that went viral (as they are the most harmful ones, as they reach a wider audience), and understand how it differs from other viral tweets (that do not contain fake news). For our study, we consider that a tweet went viral if it was retweeted more than 1000 times."

A simple MT-based translate-to-source approach at inference time is currently used to enable the deployment of the system in other languages: 1) the pool of responses in each language is translated to English by Google Translate beforehand, and pre-computed encodings of their English translations are used as representations of each foreign language response; 2) a provided user utterance (i.e., context) is translated to English on-the-fly and its encoding $h_c$ is then learned. We plan to experiment with more sophisticated multilingual models in future work."

Depending on the topic, vocabulary and nature of cyberbullying changes. These models are not flexible in accommodating changes in the definition of cyberbullying. Third (Bottleneck B3), they rely on carefully handcrafted features such as swear word list and POS tagging. However, these handcrafted features are not robust against variations in writing style. In contrast to existing bottlenecks, this work targets three different types of social networks (Formspring: a Q&A forum, Twitter: microblogging, and Wikipedia: collaborative knowledge repository) for three topics of cyberbullying (personal attack, racism, and sexism) without doing any explicit feature engineering by developing deep learning based models along with transfer learning."

Each dataset addresses a different topic of cyberbullying. Twitter dataset contains examples of racism and sexism. Wikipedia dataset contains examples of personal attack. However, Formspring dataset is not specifically about any single topic. All three datasets have the problem of class imbalance where posts labeled as cyberbullying are in the minority as compared to neutral posts. Variation in the number of posts across datasets also affects vocabulary size that represents the number of distinct words encountered in the dataset. We measure the size of a post in terms of the number of words in the post. For each dataset, there are only a few posts with large size. We truncate such large posts to the size of post ranked at 95 percentile in that dataset. For example, in Wikipedia dataset, the largest post has 2846 words. However, size of post ranked at 95 percentile in that dataset is only 231. Any post larger than size 231 in Wikipedia dataset will be truncated by considering only first 231 words. This truncation affects only a small minority of posts in each dataset. However, it is required for efficiently training various models in our experiments. Details of each dataset are as follows."

Also, in order to accommodate structural diversity in languages BIBREF1 , we can expect an edge in the parse tree in one language to correspond to more than one edge, or rather, a path, in the other language parse tree. This has been captured in the examples in figures FIGREF6 (A) and FIGREF6 (B). For an edge in the English parse tree, we term the corresponding edge or path in the Hindi parse tree as the projection or projected path of the English edge on the Hindi parse tree, and similarly there are projected paths from Hindi to English. For matters of simplicity, we ignore the direction of the edges in the parse trees.

          "For our single-label topic classification experiments, we use the Switchboard Telephone Speech Corpus BIBREF21 , a collection of two-sided telephone conversations. We use the same development (dev) and evaluation (eval) data sets as in BIBREF8 , BIBREF9 . Each whole conversation has two sides and one single topic, and topic ID is performed on each individual-side speech (i.e., each side is seen as one single spoken document). In the 35.7 hour dev data, there are 360 conversation sides evenly distributed across six different topics (recycling, capital punishment, drug testing, family finance, job benefits, car buying), i.e., each topic has equal number of 60 sides. In the 61.6 hour eval data, there are another different six topics (family life, news media, public education, exercise/fitness, pets, taxes) evenly distributed across 600 conversation sides. Algorithm design choices are explored through experiments on dev data. We use manual segmentations provided by the Switchboard corpus to produce utterances with speech activity, and UTD and AUD are operating only on those utterances.",
          "We further evaluate our topic ID performance on the speech corpora of three languages released by the DARPA LORELEI (Low Resource Languages for Emergent Incidents) Program. For each language there are a number of audio speech files, and each speech file is cut into segments of various lengths (up to 120 seconds). Each speech segment is seen as either in-domain or out-of-domain. In-domain data is defined as any speech segment relating to an incident or incidents, and in-domain data will fall into a set of domain-specific categories; these categories are known as situation types, or in-domain topics. There are 11 situation types: “Civil Unrest or Wide-spread Crime”, “Elections and Politics”, “Evacuation”, “Food Supply”, “Urgent Rescue”, “Utilities, Energy, or Sanitation”, “Infrastructure”, “Medical Assistance”, “Shelter”, “Terrorism or other Extreme Violence”, and “Water Supply”. We consider “Out-of-domain” as the 12th topic label, so each speech segment either corresponds to one or multiple in-domain topics, or is “Out-of-domain”. We use the average precision (AP, equal to the area under the precision-recall curve) as the evaluation metric, and report both the AP across the overall 12 labels, and the AP across 11 situation types, as shown in Table TABREF18 . For each configuration, only a single 10-fold CV result is reported, since we observe less variance in results here than in Switchboard. We have 16.5 hours in-domain data and 8.5 hours out-of-domain data for Turkish, 2.9 and 13.2 hours for Uzbek, and 7.7 and 7.2 hours for Mandarin. We use the same CNN architecture as on Switchboard but make the changes as described in Section SECREF11 . Also we use mini-batch size 30 and fix the training epochs as 100. All CNNs use word2vec pre-training. Additionally, we also implement another two separate topic ID baselines using the decoded word outputs from two supervised ASR systems, trained from 80 hours transcribed Babel Turkish speech BIBREF29 and about 170 hours transcribed HKUST Mandarin telephone speech (LDC2005T32 and LDC2005S15), respectively."

The error types that the model manages well can be traced back to having a strong monolingual language model, a common trait of a good NMT model. As the model operates on the level of word parts and its vocabulary is limited, this leads to combining wrong word parts, sometimes across languages. This could be fixed by either using character-based NMT or doing automatic spelling correction prior to applying our current model."

To better analyze model generalization to an unseen, new domain as well as model leveraging the out-of-domain sources, we propose a new architecture which is an extension of the ARED model. In order to better select, aggregate and control the semantic information, a Refinement Adjustment LSTM-based component (RALSTM) is introduced to the decoder side. The proposed model can learn from unaligned data by jointly training the sentence planning and surface realization to produce natural language sentences. We conducted experiments on four different NLG domains and found that the proposed methods significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art methods regarding BLEU BIBREF15 and slot error rate ERR scores BIBREF4 . The results also showed that our generators could scale to new domains by leveraging the out-of-domain data. To sum up, we make three key contributions in this paper:"

By using back-translation BIBREF3 to paraphrase each training instance, we obtain another English version of the training set that better resembles the test set, obtaining substantial improvements for the Translate-Test and Zero-Shot approaches in cross-lingual Natural Language Inference (NLI). While improvements brought by machine translation have previously been attributed to data augmentation BIBREF4, we reject this hypothesis and show that the phenomenon is only present in translated test sets, but not in original ones. Instead, our analysis reveals that this behavior is caused by subtle artifacts arising from the translation process itself. In particular, we show that translating different parts of each instance separately (e.g. the premise and the hypothesis in NLI) can alter superficial patterns in the data (e.g. the degree of lexical overlap between them), which severely affects the generalization ability of current models. Based on the gained insights, we improve the state-of-the-art in XNLI, and show that some previous findings need to be reconsidered in the light of this phenomenon.",
          "In order to better understand how systems trained on original and translated data differ, we run additional experiments on the NLI Stress Tests BIBREF19, which were designed to test the robustness of NLI models to specific linguistic phenomena in English. The benchmark consists of a competence test, which evaluates the ability to understand antonymy relation and perform numerical reasoning, a distraction test, which evaluates the robustness to shallow patterns like lexical overlap and the presence of negation words, and a noise test, which evaluates robustness to spelling errors. Just as with previous experiments, we report results for the best epoch checkpoint in each test set."

Similarly, BIBREF18 showed that NLI models tend to predict entailment for sentence pairs with a high lexical overlap. Several authors have worked on adversarial datasets to diagnose these issues and provide a more challenging benchmark BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21. Besides NLI, other tasks like QA have also been found to be susceptible to annotation artifacts BIBREF22, BIBREF23.

Quite remarkably, MT-ES and MT-FI also outperform Orig by a substantial margin, and are only 0.8 points below their BT-ES and BT-FI counterparts. Recall that, for these two systems, training is done in machine translated Spanish or Finnish, while inference is done in machine translated English. This shows that the loss of performance when generalizing from original data to machine translated data is substantially larger than the loss of performance when generalizing from one language to another.",

This feels intuitive, as translating the premise and hypothesis independently—as BT-FI and MT-FI do—is likely to reduce the lexical overlap between them.

Similarly, BIBREF18 showed that NLI models tend to predict entailment for sentence pairs with a high lexical overlap. Several authors have worked on adversarial datasets to diagnose these issues and provide a more challenging benchmark BIBREF19, BIBREF20, BIBREF21. Besides NLI, other tasks like QA have also been found to be susceptible to annotation artifacts BIBREF22, BIBREF23.

The improvement when the difficult subset with expert annotations is mixed with the remaining crowd annotation is 3.5 F1 score, much larger than when a random set of expert annotations are added. The model trained with re-annotating the difficult subset (D+Other) also outperforms the model with re-annotating the random subset (R+Other) by 2 points in F1. The model trained with re-annotating both of difficult and random subsets (D+R+Other), however, achieves only marginally higher F1 than the model trained with the re-annotated difficult subset (D+Other). In sum, the results clearly indicate that mixing expert and crowd annotations leads to better models than using solely crowd data, and better than using expert data alone. More importantly, there is greater gain in performance when instances are routed according to difficulty, as compared to randomly selecting the data for expert annotators. These findings align with our motivating hypothesis that annotation quality for difficult instances is important for final model performance. They also indicate that mixing annotations from expert and crowd could be an effective way to achieve acceptable model performance given a limited budget."

To effectively leverage this noisy sensationalism score as the reward for RL, we propose a novel loss function, ARL, to automatically balance RL with MLE. Human evaluation confirms the effectiveness of both our sensationalism scorer and ARL to generate more sensational headlines.

Our Pointer-Gen+ARL-SEN model achieves the best performance of 60.8%. This is an absolute improvement of 18.2% over the Pointer-Gen baseline. The Chi-square test on the results confirms that Pointer-Gen+ARL-SEN is statistically significantly more sensational than all the other baseline models, with the largest p-value less than 0.01. Also, we find that the test set headlines achieves 57.8% sensationalism score, much larger than Pointer-Gen baseline, which also supports our intuition that generated headlines will be less sensational than the original one. On the other hand, we found that Pointer-Gen+Pos is much worse than other baselines. The reason is that training on sensational samples alone discards around 80% of the whole training set that is also helpful for maintaining relevance and a good language model. It shows the necessity of using RL."

          "To evaluate the sensationalism intensity score $\\alpha _{\\text{sen}}$ of a headline, we collect a sensationalism dataset and then train a sensationalism scorer. For the sensationalism dataset collection, we choose headlines with many comments from popular online websites as positive samples. For the negative samples, we propose to use the generated headlines from a sentence summarization model. Intuitively, the summarization model, which is trained to preserve the semantic meaning, will lose the sensationalization ability and thus the generated negative samples will be less sensational than the original one, similar to the obfuscation of style after back-translation BIBREF4. For example, an original headline like UTF8gbsn“一趟挣10万？铁总增开申通、顺丰专列\" (One trip to earn 100 thousand? China Railway opens new Shentong and Shunfeng special lines) will become UTF8gbsn“中铁总将增开京广两列快递专列\" (China Railway opens two special lines for express) from the baseline model, which loses the sensational phrases of UTF8gbsn“一趟挣10万？\" (One trip to earn 100 thousand?) . We then train the sensationalism scorer by classifying sensational and non-sensational headlines using a one-layer CNN with a binary cross entropy loss $L_{\\text{sen}}$. Firstly, 1-D convolution is used to extract word features from the input embeddings of a headline. This is followed by a ReLU activation layer and a max-pooling layer along the time dimension. All features from different channels are concatenated together and projected to the sensationalism score by adding another fully connected layer with sigmoid activation. Binary cross entropy is used to compute the loss $L_{\\text{sen}}$."

We attribute this to the fact that we are reading out at each iteration from 1 to $T$ (see Eq. DISPLAY_FORM18), which enables the final graph representation to encode a mixture of low-level and high-level features. Indeed, in initial experiments involving readout at $t$=$T$ only, setting $T\\ge 2$ was always decreasing performance, despite the GRU-based updates (Eq. DISPLAY_FORM14). These results were consistent with that of BIBREF53 and BIBREF9, who both are reading out only at $t$=$T$ too. We hypothesize that node features at $T\\ge 2$ are too diffuse to be entirely relied upon during readout. More precisely, initially at $t$=0, node representations capture information about words, at $t$=1, about their 1-hop neighborhood (bigrams), at $t$=2, about compositions of bigrams, etc. Thus, pretty quickly, node features become general and diffuse. In such cases, considering also the lower-level, more precise features of the earlier iterations when reading out may be necessary.",

          "This contrasts with much of the work in computational text analysis, which tends to focus on automating tasks that humans perform inefficiently. These tasks range from core linguistically motivated tasks that constitute the backbone of natural language processing, such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, to filtering spam and detecting sentiment. Many tasks are motivated by applications, for example to automatically block online trolls. Success, then, is often measured by performance, and communicating why a certain prediction was made—for example, why a document was labeled as positive sentiment, or why a word was classified as a noun—is less important than the accuracy of the prediction itself. The approaches we use and what we mean by `success' are thus guided by our research questions.",
          "Domain experts and fellow researchers can provide feedback on questions and help with dynamically revising them. For example, they may say “we already think we know that”, “that's too naïve”, “that doesn't reflect social reality” (negative); “two major camps in the field would give different answers to that question” (neutral); “we tried to look at that back in the 1960s, but we didn't have the technology” (positive); and “that sounds like something that people who made that archive would love”, “that's a really fundamental question” (very positive).",
          "Sometimes we also hope to connect to multiple disciplines. For example, while focusing on the humanistic concerns of an archive, we could also ask social questions such as “is this archive more about collaborative processes, culture-building or norm creation?” or “how well does this archive reflect the society in which it is embedded?\" BIBREF3 used quantitative methods to tell a story about Darwin's intellectual development—an essential biographical question for a key figure in the history of science. At the same time, their methods connected Darwin's development to the changing landscape of Victorian scientific culture, allowing them to contrast Darwin's “foraging” in the scientific literature of his time to the ways in which that literature was itself produced. Finally, their methods provided a case study, and validation of technical approaches, for cognitive scientists who are interested in how people explore and exploit sources of knowledge.",
          "Questions about potential “dual use” may also arise. Returning to our introductory example, BIBREF0 started with a deceptively simple question: if an internet platform eliminates forums for hate speech, does this impact hate speech in other forums? The research was motivated by the belief that a rising tide of online hate speech was (and is) making the internet increasingly unfriendly for disempowered groups, including minorities, women, and LBGTQ individuals. Yet the possibility of dual use troubled the researchers from the onset. Could the methodology be adopted to target the speech of groups like Black Lives Matter? Could it be adopted by repressive governments to minimize online dissent? While these concerns remained, they concluded that hypothetical dual use scenarios did not outweigh the tangible contribution this research could offer towards making the online environment more equal and just."

          "In this phase we develop measures (or, “operationalizations”, or “indicators”) for the concepts of interest, a process called “operationalization”. Regardless of whether we are working with computers, the output produced coincides with Adcock and Collier's “scores”—the concrete translation and output of the systematized concept into numbers or labels BIBREF13 . Choices made during this phase are always tied to the question “Are we measuring what we intend to measure?” Does our operationalization match our conceptual definition? To ensure validity we must recognize gaps between what is important and what is easy to measure. We first discuss modeling considerations. Next, we describe several frequently used computational approaches and their limitations and strengths.",
          "Modeling considerations",
          "The variables (both predictors and outcomes) are rarely simply binary or categorical. For example, a study on language use and age could focus on chronological age (instead of, e.g., social age BIBREF19 ). However, even then, age can be modeled in different ways. Discretization can make the modeling easier and various NLP studies have modeled age as a categorical variable BIBREF20 . But any discretization raises questions: How many categories? Where to place the boundaries? Fine distinctions might not always be meaningful for the analysis we are interested in, but categories that are too broad can threaten validity. Other interesting variables include time, space, and even the social network position of the author. It is often preferable to keep the variable in its most precise form. For example, BIBREF21 perform exploration in the context of hypothesis testing by using latitude and longitude coordinates — the original metadata attached to geotagged social media such as tweets — rather than aggregating into administrative units such as counties or cities. This is necessary when such administrative units are unlikely to be related to the target concept, as is the case in their analysis of dialect differences. Focusing on precise geographical coordinates also makes it possible to recognize fine-grained effects, such as language variation across the geography of a city.",
          "Using a particular classification scheme means deciding which variations are visible, and which ones are hidden BIBREF22 . We are looking for a categorization scheme for which it is feasible to collect a large enough labeled document collection (e.g., to train supervised models), but which is also fine-grained enough for our purposes. Classification schemes rarely exhibit the ideal properties, i.e., that they are consistent, their categories are mutually exclusive, and that the system is complete BIBREF22 . Borderline cases are challenging, especially with social and cultural concepts, where the boundaries are often not clear-cut. The choice of scheme can also have ethical implications BIBREF22 . For example, gender is usually represented as a binary variable in NLP and computational models tend to learn gender-stereotypical patterns. The operationalization of gender in NLP has been challenged only recently BIBREF23 , BIBREF24 , BIBREF25 .",
          "Supervised and unsupervised learning are the most common approaches to learning from data. With supervised learning, a model learns from labeled data (e.g., social media messages labeled by sentiment) to infer (or predict) these labels from unlabeled texts. In contrast, unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data. Supervised approaches are especially suitable when we have a clear definition of the concept of interest and when labels are available (either annotated or native to the data). Unsupervised approaches, such as topic models, are especially useful for exploration. In this setting, conceptualization and operationalization may occur simultaneously, with theory emerging from the data BIBREF26 . Unsupervised approaches are also used when there is a clear way of measuring a concept, often based on strong assumptions. For example, BIBREF3 measure “surprise” in an analysis of Darwin's reading decisions based on the divergence between two probability distributions.",
          "From an analysis perspective, the unit of text that we are labeling (or annotating, or coding), either automatic or manual, can sometimes be different than one's final unit of analysis. For example, if in a study on media frames in news stories, the theoretical framework and research question point toward frames at the story level (e.g., what is the overall causal analysis of the news article?), the story must be the unit of analysis. Yet it is often difficult to validly and reliably code a single frame at the story level. Multiple perspectives are likely to sit side-by-side in a story. Thus, an article on income inequality might point to multiple causes, such as globalization, education, and tax policies. Coding at the sentence level would detect each of these causal explanations individually, but this information would need to be somehow aggregated to determine the overall story-level frame. Sometimes scholars solve this problem by only examining headlines and lead paragraphs, arguing that based on journalistic convention, the most important information can be found at the beginning of a story. However, this leads to a return to a shorter, less nuanced analysis.",
          "From a computational perspective, the unit of text can also make a huge difference, especially when we are using bag-of-words models, where word order within a unit does not matter. Small segments, like tweets, sometimes do not have enough information to make their semantic context clear. In contrast, larger segments, like novels, have too much variation, making it difficult to train focused models. Finding a good segmentation sometimes means combining short documents and subdividing long documents. The word “document\" can therefore be misleading. But it is so ingrained in the common NLP lexicon that we use it anyway in this article.",
          "For insight-driven text analysis, it is often critical that high-level patterns can be communicated. Furthermore, interpretable models make it easier to find spurious features, to do error analysis, and to support interpretation of results. Some approaches are effective for prediction, but harder to interpret. The value we place on interpretability can therefore influence the approach we choose. There is an increasing interest in developing interpretable or transparent models in the NLP and machine learning communities."

          "We typically start by identifying the questions we wish to explore. Can text analysis provide a new perspective on a “big question” that has been attracting interest for years? Or can we raise new questions that have only recently emerged, for example about social media? For social scientists working in computational analysis, the questions are often grounded in theory, asking: How can we explain what we observe? These questions are also influenced by the availability and accessibility of data sources. For example, the choice to work with data from a particular social media platform may be partly determined by the fact that it is freely available, and this will in turn shape the kinds of questions that can be asked. A key output of this phase are the concepts to measure, for example: influence; copying and reproduction; the creation of patterns of language use; hate speech. Computational analysis of text motivated by these questions is insight driven: we aim to describe a phenomenon or explain how it came about. For example, what can we learn about how and why hate speech is used or how this changes over time? Is hate speech one thing, or does it comprise multiple forms of expression? Is there a clear boundary between hate speech and other types of speech, and what features make it more or less ambiguous? In these cases, it is critical to communicate high-level patterns in terms that are recognizable.",
