2. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS: Biblical Books by Verse Count
=========================================================================================

CHALLENGE: The Bible text format embeds chapter:verse references within continuous text
rather than as separate line markers. Example from line 1000-1050:

"12:14 And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt...
12:15 The princes also of Pharaoh saw her..."

The text does not have clear book headers at verse lines, making automated verse counting
by book challenging. Book names appear primarily in the table of contents (lines 20-70).

Books mentioned in the text include:
- Genesis (The First Book of Moses)
- Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy
- Joshua, Judges, Ruth
- Samuel (1st & 2nd), Kings (1st & 2nd), Chronicles (1st & 2nd)
- Psalms (The Book of Psalms)
- Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel
- Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, etc.

Due to the embedded format, exact verse counts per book require parsing the full text
with book boundary detection. Sample verse references found:
- Line 1016: "12:19" (Genesis context)
- Line 33322: "12:17" (Kings context)
